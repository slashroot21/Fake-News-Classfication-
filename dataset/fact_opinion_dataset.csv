Reuters reported that Pemex’s crew used nitrogen to finally control the fire from the pipeline.The blaze erupted at 5:15 a.m. local time about 150 yards from an oil platform and operations returned to “normal” at 10:45 after the fire was extinguished, Bloomberg reported, citing a company statement.No injuries or major impact on production were reported after the early-morning fire.The full extent of any environmental damage was not yet known. Angel Carrizales, head of Mexico’s oil safety regulator ASEA, insisted on Twitter that the incident “did not generate any spill” — but failed to explain what was burning on the water, Reuters noted.Pemex has had a history of accidents.Ku Maloob Zaap is Pemex’s largest crude oil producers, and accounts for more than 40% of its total 1.7 million barrels of daily crude production. Production has been declining at Ku Maloob Zaap as fields mature and Pemex doesn’t have enough resources to invest in new extraction technologies, Bloomberg reported.Pemex output has dropped each year for more than a decade, has the largest debt of any major oil operation — almost $114 billion, according to Bloomberg.",Fact,Huffington Post
https://www.indy100.com/news/northern-ireland-same-sex-marriage-lgbt-gay-rights-equality-9329006,Two years ago I was forced to marry my husband outside Northern Ireland – today the law finally says we matter,"I always wanted to get married in Derry – the city of my birth and the city that I love.It’s a place like no other, where the air sings its own tunes and the sense of humour is like a second language. Like much of Northern Ireland, it bears the scars and traumas of recent decades but now hope cuts through – just like the Peace Bridge which has planted a modern facade on its landscape.Across the past decade we moved on in so many ways, and with every trip back home I was overwhelmed by how progressive people had become. There is something about overcoming the hardships that we did which reminds people that loving who you want is nothing to fear.Derry is the cradle of civil rights. My grandfather was among the generation in the 1960s who said ‘no more’ and took to the streets to demand basic things like one man one vote, an end to gerrymandering, access to housing and jobs – all of which was denied overwhelmingly to the Catholic population by the unionist government, while London turned a blind eye.For a few years, London again turned that blind eye while unionists in Belfast denied equal rights – this time to members of the LBGTQ+ community. It wasn’t easy to call out the DUP’s misuse of their veto in Stormont when they were propping the Conservatives up at Westminster.But they were on the wrong side of history. The law was changing in countries all around us, and a poll in April 2018 found that 76 per cent of people in Northern Ireland backed marriage equality. I didn’t want to wait any longer.I married my husband Dom that summer in Donegal, just 20 minutes across the border, where marriage equality had been ratified in that historic 2015 referendum. Then, back in Derry, we held the kind of celebration I had always wanted. It was a glorious day, and people were visibly moved to be part of a union which was not just the cementing of a great love affair, but also a political act.Our marriage may not have been legally recognised by the law in Northern Ireland, but it was validated by the love and admiration we felt from a room full of our closest family and friends.I felt this power again in 2019 when I attended the wedding of one of my oldest friends Danielle and her new wife Emma – another ceremony we had to hop the border for. But eventually, the dam broke. Political opponents of equality may not have relented, but they acknowledged that the horse had bolted and so, they simply let it go. Today, we’ll see the first same-gender wedding in Northern Ireland between Robyn Peoples and Sharni Edwards, and it’s about time.Now, when I go back to Derry, I’ll have the satisfaction of knowing that my marriage there is legal. I’ll also know that in younger generations, people like me will be growing up in the full knowledge that their love is as equal under the law as anyone else’s, and that they matter too.As a person, I still feel I have a long way to go in life. But with a husband, I feel stronger and more ready to face the future. In Northern Ireland too, we have such a long way to go as a society. But with the introduction of marriage equality, and the widening of our embrace around marginalised citizens, we will also be stronger and better prepared for building a new society, free from the mistakes of the past.",Opinion,Independent

Because no one expects their lives to be turned upside down on a Tuesday night, do they? That night changed my life and I spent the summer of 2018 as a wheelchair user and a campaigner for disabled passenger rights on British railways.When meningitis and sepsis struck in June 2018, everything I ever thought I knew about the world and how to travel around it changed. My usual commute to work on Fleet Street would take me from my picturesque village in Wivenhoe, Essex, to Stratford and a quick journey on the Central line: the only thing that bothered me would be if a train was delayed by a few minutes.Like the majority of the population, I had absolutely no idea of the struggle wheelchair users face on a daily basis. Just today, news emerged that more than 40 per cent of UK stations are not accessible to physically disabled people, according to research by disability charity Leonard Cheshire.My latest struggle involved Greater Anglia using a designated wheelchair space as a catering service, selling tea and coffee from the space and piling up boxes by my feet so I couldn’t even get my wheelchair into a safe position. The photograph and videos went viral.Greater Anglia were “sorry [I] felt upset” – not sorry it messed up, but sorry that I was apparently emotionally incapable and should be thankful for the company even allowing me on the train. Not sorry for the huge health and safety risk or the fact trolleys can apparently go somewhere else, but sorry I felt a certain way. Needless to say, its patronising response has turned into an example of what not to do when faced with a PR crisis.But once the radio interviews and newspaper articles died down, the real question remained: how do we make a stand against train companies who know we rely on them to facilitate the most mundane parts of our day-to-day life?Fancy popping off to the seaside for the afternoon? Or staying in the office an hour later to catch up on emails? If you’re a wheelchair user and travel by train, these everyday decisions are impossible. Rail companies demand you book travel assistance up to 24 hours in advance, meaning any sort of spontaneity is taken away from you.Paralympian Lady Tanni Grey-Thomson has repeatedly called for rail companies to not only make their rules linear across providers, but also to abolish the outdated procedures that discriminate against disabled passengers.Once you have jumped through hoops to organise your transport, there is absolutely no guarantee you’ll be assisted and treated with dignity. As my local train station is only accessible on one platform – something I’d never really thought about when I was able-bodied – Greater Anglia has to provide me with a wheelchair-assisted taxi to take me from the nearest station back to my local one. At times, the taxi just hasn’t turned up or a regular car, suitable for those who are able-bodied, has turned up instead, which adds insult to injury – quite literally.Have you ever considered what you’d do if your assistance simply wasn’t there at your end destination? Comedian Tanyalee Davis uses a mobility scooter and has, on at least one occasion, been left on the train after a member of staff failed to turn up with the necessary ramp.And what difference does pre-booking make if there’s zero communication between train companies and platform staff?I’ve received hundreds of similar stories on Twitter, and the impact that the lack of travel assistance is having on the mental health of disabled users is huge. I’ve been subject to several panic attacks on platforms; I refuse to travel on my own after being left stranded by staff who treated me like I’m a huge inconvenience; and I’m missing out on job opportunities because I don’t trust Greater Anglia to provide their duty of care twice a day for a commute.What rail companies don’t realise is their complicated procedures and sloppy staff members are causing disabled people to stay inside more, to isolate themselves and to be afraid of speaking out again because they know these complaints go absolutely nowhere.Because it doesn’t matter if you’ve been in a wheelchair all your life or for the last three months like me. Even if you’re completely able-bodied, the need for ease of travel is a human right and you never know what you’ve got until it’s gone.The journey starts now. It starts with making our voices heard; jumping through the hoops we have to in order to make formal complaints and demanding change. Not promises, not apologies. Change.",Opinion,Independent
https://www.indy100.com/people/furlough-scheme-boris-johnson-workers-class-rich-9518991,Don't be fooled into thinking the furlough scheme is doing you a favour – it's about protecting the rich,"At the onset of the UK lockdown, in one of his press briefings, Boris Johnson said something extremely unexpected: that he was aware that after the financial crisis, the banks had been bailed out while the people had not.This time, he insisted, this would not be the case. And on the surface it looks like he has kept his word – the furlough scheme has been extended this week, with millions of workers’ incomes protected at up to 80 per cent.But if we look at who is slipping through the gaps in the furlough scheme – who can and can’t work from home, who is on the frontline without PPE or who is expected to pay for the furlough and emergency packages – it’s the same old story of protecting the rich before everyone else.The Office of Budget Responsibility has chalked up the cost of the now extended furlough scheme and other emergency interventions to £123bn. This, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and his colleagues claim, is an intervention on a larger scale than other rich nations.Yet the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) actually found that, as a proportion of national income, we are relatively modest compared several countries – including Japan, the USA, Canada and Germany. And there’s something else to consider: while £123bn is a huge sum, equivalent to 5.9 per cent of national income or the full running cost of the NHS in 2017, it is still less that the bank bailouts that totaled at £137bn.So why are we acting like the government is doing taxpayers a favour?Yes, you can argue that we got stakes in the banks so got some of the money back. You could also argue that providing income for people to avoid mass redundancies and millions of homes being repossessed and renters kicked out is worth the investment in both the short and long-term. We have bought a stake in the people of this country – and their hard work is what will get the economy going again.But this is not the language we're hearing.In recent weeks we have heard that senior government officials are worried about workers getting “addicted” to the furlough scheme, and leaked Treasury documents discussing how to tax people more and freeze public sector pay to recoup the costs of the emergency bailout of businesses and workers. The banks were given time to repay their debts, and that was a crisis of their making. It seems everyday people aren’t coming first after all – not now, and not in preparations for what comes after the lockdown.And what about within the mechanics of the emergency package? With any intervention there are those that gain more than others – and despite the rhetoric, when you follow the money you find it is disproportionately helping those with housing wealth. A new study published by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) calculates that 13 per cent of state spending on the furlough scheme is likely to end up in the pockets of landlords – amounting to £2.8bn under a three-month lockdown.Once they add mortgage and loan repayments, this rises to a combined 45 per cent of total spending of the furlough scheme. So while the money is going to workers, it is also a de facto bailout for landlords and the banks. Banks are not forgiving debt, of course: mortgage holidays are just deferred payments and many are still charging obscene interest rates on credit cards and overdrafts. After taxpayers bailed out the banks in 2008, you might think they would try to return the favour.Inequalities are being greatly exacerbated in this crisis.New research from my think tank the Centre for Labour and Social Studies (CLASS) confirms that it is those on lower incomes and precarious employment contracts that are being worse hit. Conversely, a third of key workers are paid less than £10 a hour, and more than half of care workers – meaning those most exposed to the virus are also on often on less than a real Living Wage. It’s a massive slap in the face. As if things won’t bad enough, those on lower incomes, in deprived areas and ethnic minorities are more likely to die from the coronavirus.Nothing the government has done so far has sought to ameliorate these disparities. They haven’t even done the basic and easy stuff – like demand that any bailouts via the furlough scheme or loans can only be given to companies who pay their taxes here. It is almost as if they don’t see the inequalities at all.Meanwhile, it’s those that can’t work from home – those in construction, manufacturing and people facing roles that are being told to return to work.If they don’t drive or live close to their workplace, like the majority of working class and young Londoners and millions in other cities in the UK, they have to get on public transport. If it’s not safe enough for the middle class who are much more likely to be able to work from home – why is it safe enough for the working class?Now the government is also trying to push teachers and others back to work – cloaking their demands in language of bravery and heroism. Maybe people just want to be safe in their workplaces, as is their right.Covid-19 has unleashed a whole new class struggle.The bleak truth is that those on lower incomes – often doing the work that is keeping the wheels on society, are the ones who will end up in more debt, more precarious housing situations and sick or even dead. There is one last opportunity to reverse these obscene inequalities – thorough building in equality measures into any recovery plan. Given the track record of Conservative governments since 2010, I wouldn’t hold your breath.",Opinion,Independent

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/07/opinion/google-utility-antitrust-technology.html,Let’s Make Google a Public Good,"American law recognizes that some critically important businesses must accept all customers and treat everyone fairly because they are not easily or economically efficient to duplicate — think railroads, electricity providers and telephone companies.As Ohio’s attorney general, I went to court last month asking for a judicial declaration that Google has evolved into such an entity: a public utility of internet search.Google is ubiquitous. More web traffic goes to Google and YouTube, a subsidiary of Google, than the other top 50 websites combined. And it’s not just internet traffic: Google dominates internet search, cornering nearly 90 percent of the U.S. search market, and even more globally. Bing, the runner-up in internet search, claims a mere 6 percent of the U.S. market and 2 percent globally.More than 30 states, including my own, have joined in a bipartisan antitrust action against Google. But, separately, Ohio is pursuing Google under the common law of public utility — a tactic that I urge other states to consider.Should Ohio prevail in its lawsuit, there will be no heavy-handed “Mother May I?” antitrust regulation in which the government tells Google how to run its business or how to write its algorithms. Nor, unlike antitrust law, does Ohio’s suit seek to reduce the number of Google users. We are not even asking for monetary damages — just a simple declaration that, under the law, Google is a public utility, or more generally, a common carrier.As a common-law public utility, Google would then have a legal duty to act with consideration of the public interest, to provide equal access to all users and all information providers and to act without unreasonable bias against information providers, particularly Google’s competitors in other business lines. That’s it. As legal touches go, it’s a lot lighter than what antitrust law would demand. (Google has said the Ohio lawsuit “has no basis in fact or law” and that it will defend itself against it in court.)Once Google is declared a common carrier, the average web user’s experience of search would, for the most part, remain the same. That’s largely because, when you use Google to search, you’re not the customer — you’re the product. Google uses your detailed personal information for targeting ads.The subtle common-carrier changes for users will be positive, such as showing you the results you requested instead of being steered to Google products. My lawsuit alleges that Google prioritizes its own products and platforms in search results. According to the market research company SparkToro, at least 65 percent of Google searches in 2020 were “zero-click searches” — that is, the consumer never left Google when conducting a search. And an investigation by The Markup found that a search for, say, flights, can first bring up results from Google Flights — while competitors such as Travelocity and Orbitz can be shut out.As a public utility, Google search would have to give others a better shot. Those searching would get results that are not skewed to Google, and the marketplace would be a bit more competitive.Once a court declares Google a public utility, the marketplace itself would provide the guardrails. Those who felt they were not getting a fair shake could seek redress in court, though modern public utilities largely follow the rules, and we would not expect Google to face an avalanche of litigation.The duty for a public utility to operate in the public interest dates back to English common law, when key economic players such as ferry operators had to fulfill certain obligations to the public. During the Gilded Age, the railroad magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt controlled a bridge that was key to getting to New York City by train. In the late 1860s, he closed the bridge to rivals, effectively shutting the rest of the country out of its largest port, and the city off from food supplies from the west.As the competing railroads’ stock crashed, he quickly bought up a controlling position. As a result, Vanderbilt used his control of a chokepoint to help establish a monopoly. To curb such predations, Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 and subsequently began codifying common-carrier and public-utility law.But the common law regarding public utilities remains in many places — including Ohio. Statutory regulation will produce different results from the common law because while codification requires detailed regulations addressing all issues upfront, the common law allows for nuanced lawmaking tailored to each specific dispute.Critics of Ohio’s lawsuit abound, of course. To knock down a few straw men: Ohio’s action is not chilling Google’s right to free speech. To the contrary, Google will remain free to say anything it pleases. What it may not do is restrain the commerce of others by using its monopolistic powers in search to corner other markets.Critics also say that this creates a “dormant Commerce Clause” problem — that one state among 50 is using its law in a manner that burdens interstate commerce, a violation of sovereignty and federalism. But Google can geo-fence Ohio if it chooses (and the other states that will most likely follow Ohio’s lead).The truth of the matter is that foreign governments already are regulating cyberspaces around the world, and with a far heavier hand. The European Union requires cookie warnings and privacy safeguards. Google just settled France’s lawsuit about Google’s advertising infrastructure.Google’s initial response in our case is due in the next few weeks. The preface to Google’s parent company’s code of conduct says, “Do the right thing — follow the law, act honorably and treat co-workers with courtesy, support and respect.” Google could do that by acknowledging what is obvious: It’s so dominant that the rules of private companies no longer apply to it.",Opinion,NY Times
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/07/opinion/venezuela-landmark-university.html,"This World Heritage Site Is in Ruins, and That’s Not by Accident","When the main campus of the Central University of Venezuela (Universidad Central de Venezuela, or U.C.V.) was declared a World Heritage Site in 2000, UNESCO deemed it “a masterpiece of modern city planning, architecture and art” and an “outstanding example of the coherent realization of the urban, architectural and artistic ideals of the early 20th century.”Two decades later, this paradigm of art — an emblem of Caracas and the pride of Venezuela’s public education system — is in ruins, and its demise may go unnoticed in a country that’s suffered so much loss.Last year, a section of the roof covering the walkway connecting the university’s buildings collapsed because of a lack of maintenance. In the absence of resources to tend to the drainage, the columns holding up the roof fractured under the weight of storm water pooled on the structure’s corrugated surface. And that’s just the most glaring example of U.C.V.’s deterioration. On June 30 the building that houses the school of political science caught fire. The university’s fire department and local firefighters struggled to extinguish the flames because of the water shortage.It’s as if the honor bestowed by UNESCO were a condemnation and not a designation of excellence. Yet the university is far from the country’s only struggling institution. A 2018 report found that 95 percent of educational establishments have fallen into disrepair. Classrooms are emptying out, with dropout rates in secondary schools reaching 50 percent in 2020 largely because of the exodus of more than five million Venezuelans and the impact of the pandemic. The country is estimated to have lost about half of its teachers since 2015, and many children stay home instead of going to class because schools lack the basic infrastructure and resources to provide them with food.The degradation of our educational system is a quieter, more gradual tragedy that weighs on the soul. But its implications — the decline of one of the most important cultural and intellectual symbols in Venezuela and the potential loss of a modern architectural landmark — should be disconcerting to all of humanity. If civilization can celebrate its greatest creations, it also has a duty to protect them. UNESCO should draw attention to the demise of University City, U.C.V.’s central campus, beyond general statements of support and declare the site a World Heritage in danger. But the Venezuelan government must do its part: UNESCO will provide the financial resources necessary for conservation efforts only if Venezuela requests them.As a child born in the middle of the 20th century, I saw U.C.V. as the vibrant epicenter of Venezuela’s higher education. After the dictatorship of Juan Vicente Gómez, which ended in 1935, education was considered essential to creating a fruitful democracy. I took it for granted amid the dizzying modernization brought on by the oil boom.When I began studying architecture at the university in 1968, it felt as if U.C.V. had always existed and would be eternal. I didn’t understand its exceptionality.The reality is that U.C.V. is a modern marvel as unique as it is fragile and that its disintegration is not by chance. The university is the victim of a regime whose notion of continuity is keeping cultural symbols, especially institutions it feels threatened by, buried under absolute neglect.The Central University of Venezuela has always been a bastion against authoritarianism and the vanguard of new ideas. The politics of Hugo Chávez, who came to power in 1999, and his followers were generally unpopular among the U.C.V. student body. Students took to the street in 2007 to protest President Chávez’s moves to restrict freedom of expression. As part of his long-term strategy to weaken their influence, he denied the university and (other public institutions) essential financial resources.Continued budget restrictions and the suppression of outspoken teachers and students under President Nicolás Maduro’s administration have helped make the inconceivable happen: University City has become an archaeological ruin. The state of the site is a mirror of the country’s conditions, revealing that time in Venezuela seems to march backward. There’s a sensation that the current of history, confoundingly and devastatingly, flows in reverse. Our future seems to exist only within the constructs of a fading past.",Opinion,NY Times
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/08/bbc-climate-change-deniers-fossil-fuel-broadcasters,How the BBC let climate deniers walk all over it,"The fossil-fuel multinationals fund ‘thinktanks’ and ‘research institutes’. But it’s gullible public service broadcasters that give them credibilityYes, we should rake over the coals. And the oil, and the gas. Democratic accountability means remembering who helped to stoke the climate crisis. We should hold the fossil fuel companies to account.In 1979, an internal study by Exxon concluded that burning carbon fuels “will cause dramatic environmental effects before the year 2050”. In 1982, as the Guardian’s Climate Crimes series recalls, an Exxon memo concluded that the science of climate change was “unanimous”. Then it poured millions of dollars into lobby groups casting doubt on it.They didn’t call themselves lobby groups, but “thinktanks” or “research institutes”. Across the world, the media took them at their word.So scientists and environmental campaigners found themselves fighting the oil companies at one step removed, and with one hand tied behind their backs. When some of us were pitched against a “thinktank” in the media, if we tried to explain that it was not what it claimed to be, or asked it to reveal its funders, we were accused of being “conspiracy theorists”, or of “playing the man not the ball”. But if we didn’t, its false claims about climate science were given equal or greater weight. After all, who were we, a threadbare bunch, beside those respectable-sounding institutes with offices in Washington or Westminster?When we criticised the media for its determined naivety, we were frozen out. Before long, the thinktanks and trade associations had a clear run. They were the serious, sensible people, to whom the media turned to explain the world. And still turns.If the oil companies are to be held to account, so should the media that amplified their voices. It scarcely needs to be said that the billionaire press took the lead in attacking climate science. After all, the owners have long perceived an attack on one corporation or plutocrat as an attack on all. But far more dangerous were the public sector broadcasters – which tend to be taken more seriously, as they are widely seen as independent and unbiased.For Channel 4, winding up environmentalists became a blood sport. In films such as Against Nature and The Great Global Warming Swindle, the mistakes and distortions came so thick and fast that it was hard to see them as anything but deliberate provocations. When ?I ?complained, the channel sought to justify them with further ?unfounded claims. All that counted was noise: Channel 4, at the time, clearly couldn’t give a damn about the impacts.The BBC’s role was more insidious. Its collaboration arose from a disastrous combination of gullibility, appeasement and scientific ignorance. It let the fossil fuel industry walk all over it.When some of us pointed out that failing to ask its contributors to reveal their sources of funding was a direct breach of its own editorial guidelines, the BBC produced a series of bizarre, catch-22 excuses, and carried on breaking its rules for several years. It gave the oil and tobacco companies just what they wanted: in the words of the American Petroleum Institute, “victory will be achieved” when “recognition of uncertainties becomes part of the ‘conventional wisdom’”.Only in 2018, a mere 36 years after Exxon came to the same conclusion, did the BBC decide that climate science is solid, and there is no justification for both-sidesing it. But the nonsense continues.Last week, a group of us revealed what the BBC has been teaching children about climate breakdown. The GCSE module on BBC Bitesize listed the “positive” impacts of our global catastrophe. Among them were “more resources, such as oil, becoming available in places such as Alaska and Siberia when the ice melts”; “new tourist destinations becoming available” (welcome to Derby-on-Sea); and “warmer temperatures could lead to healthier outdoor lifestyles”.In a sterling example of the corporation’s endless confusion between balance and impartiality, the list of positives was roughly equal to the list of negatives. The greatest crisis humanity has ever faced looked like six of one and half a dozen of the other.Only when it caused a social media storm did the BBC remove this content. I asked it how, when and why this list was included, whether external organisations were involved, and why the corporation ignored previous requests to improve the module. It told me it would not be commenting. So much for public service.The frontier of denial has now shifted to the biggest of all environmental issues: farming. Here, the BBC still gives lobby groups and trade associations sowing doubt about environmental damage (especially by livestock farming) more airtime than the scientists and campaigners seeking to explain the problems.Not just airtime, but kudos. The head of the National Farmers’ Union, Minette Batters, has sought to undermine the ban on neonicotinoid pesticides, pressed for continuation of the cruel and useless badger cull, and lobbied against reductions in meat consumption, among other harmful positions. But last year, BBC’s Woman’s Hour included her on its power list of “30 inspiring women whose work is making a significant positive contribution to the environment”. She was placed above true environmental heroes such as Gail Bradbrook, Judy Ling-Wong, Franny Armstrong and Safia Minney.

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/07/living-with-the-virus-uk-vaccinated-covid-cases,‘Living with the virus’ makes no sense. Only half of the UK is fully vaccinated,"We’re heading towards 100,000 Covid cases a day, yet ministers laud ‘freedom day’. It seems no one is accountableAfter receiving my second vaccination in April, I contracted Covid a week ago. I’m now “living with the virus”, a phrase emblematic of the failure of UK public health. Just look at the relative death rates in China (population 1.4 billion), Vietnam (100 million), the United States (340 million) and the UK (68 million). When plotted on the same graph, you cannot see the death curves for those two Asian states because they are so low.Britain’s leaders and their advisers told us last year that we could not suppress the virus. China and Vietnam did, within six weeks. They told us these countries would inevitably face a huge second wave. They haven’t; just smaller outbreaks, suppressed with good public health practice implemented by people on the ground.As we know, exploding cases in March 2020 forced the UK into a 13-week full national lockdown, with huge damage to livelihoods, the economy and mental health. None of the east Asian states had national lockdowns, only local ones. In 2020, China’s GDP grew by 2% and Vietnam’s by 2.9%, according to the World Bank, compared with the UK’s 9.9% contraction.Last summer the UK government set up a privatised, call centre-based test-and-trace system divorced from our underfunded local public health and primary care teams – quite unlike anything done in successful east Asian states. It couldn’t possibly work, and it didn’t. The Treasury refused to give any financial support to poorer people to isolate – in case, as the then health secretary, Matt Hancock, told a Commons select committee, they “gamed the system”. So poor families gamed the test-and-trace system instead, to keep working and feed their families. The virus simply spread, without public health control, and was only suppressed by two more prolonged national lockdowns.The vaccines arrived with a huge wave of nationalistic fervour. We are world leaders, crowed the prime minister. The first to jab. Yes, our GP network stepped in magnificently to roll out the vaccines, but local authorities and public health remained deprived of any financial support. Meanwhile, test and trace staggered on, a fortune spent on private consultants, test companies and cronies. The £37bn spent was equivalent to a decade’s funding for the whole UK public health programme.So the third lockdown now ends in a staggered and collapsing roadmap. In February the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, was alone among advisers saying that find, test, trace and isolate was crucial when case rates fell to low levels. On 19 May, we saw only 1,517 cases a day. Yet no changes were made to our ineffective test-and-trace system – it remained outsourced, with the lowest rate of financial compensation for isolation in any OECD country. So another wave began.On Monday the prime minister told us we would have 50,000 cases a day by his so-called “freedom day” on 19 July. A day later the health secretary, Sajid Javid, said we could hit 100,000 a day this summer. But it was OK, he told us. We can “live with the virus” because we are all vaccinated.Well, all except children, and the poorest and most hesitant groups. Actually, only half Britain’s population (34 million) is fully protected with vaccines. Yes, admissions and deaths will go up, but the government can’t say by how much. The possibility of the virus becoming vaccine-resistant was not mentioned. Vaccine protection appears much less effective at stopping infection than it does at preventing serious illness or death. Talk of long Covid is seemingly taboo among ministers, even though the latest government figures show more than 2 million people have lived with symptoms for at least 12 weeks. A new study has found measurable thinning of the brain cortex areas covering taste and smell in these patients.And the government seems to think it fine for 8.8 million children up to age 16 to become infected – even though the US, Europe and Israel have vaccinated more than 7 million children because the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Our vaccine committee is still thinking about it. Meanwhile, even in English school classrooms, masks are no longer required.And what of the global vaccine shortage? At last month’s G7 meeting in Cornwall, President Joe Biden urged fellow leaders to share the patent with all countries so they can manufacture the vaccine themselves. The UK, Germany and Canada said no. Although 95% of funds to develop vaccines came from the public purse, it appears that the shareholders of big pharma companies must be protected. So a million people must die every month to sustain free markets.New variants will emerge, but those same multinationals can make new vaccines – no doubt with new patents. No new G7 money was committed to the Covax global distribution scheme. And with Indian supplies blocked, Nepal, Bangladesh and the whole of Africa have virtually no vaccines.Under the new libertarian public health system, “living with the virus” means we must not compromise people’s freedom to do what they like. If you prefer to cough and sneeze in a crowded commuter train, so be it: there’ll be no legal restriction on that. If porters, nurses, doctors, care workers, bus drivers or factory workers become infected, and if some of them die, so be it.Seemingly no one is accountable. Politicians say they follow the science. Advisers say ministers must make the decisions. An explosion of cases is imminent, the burden on the NHS could be severe, and the threat of new variants that can break through the present vaccine protection is real, as I know. Rather than a merry-go-round of birthday honours and George Crosses, we need a plan to deal with the rampant third wave – one that will keep us safe.",Opinion,Guardian
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/08/why-declining-birth-rates-are-good-news-for-life-on-earth,Why declining birth rates are good news for life on Earth,"In the midst of a climate crisis with 8 billion humans on the globe, it’s absurd to say that what’s lacking is babiesFertility rates are falling across the globe – even in places, such as sub-Saharan Africa, where they remain high. This is good for women, families, societies and the environment. So why do we keep hearing that the world needs babies, with angst in the media about maternity wards closing in Italy and ghost cities in China?The short-range answer is that, even though this slowdown was predicted as part of the now 250-year-old demographic transition – whose signature is the tumbling of both fertility and mortality rates – occasional happenings, such as the publication of US census data or China’s decision to relax its two-child policy, force it back into our consciousness, arousing fears about family lines rubbed out and diminishing superpowers being uninvited from the top table.The longer range answer is that our notion of a healthy, vibrant society is still rooted in the past. The inevitable byproduct of the demographic transition is that populations age, in a chronological sense, but life expectancy, and particularly healthy life expectancy, have increased dramatically over the last half-century, and the societal definition of “old” has not kept up (though artistic experiments such as casting 82-year-old Sir Ian McKellen as Hamlet might help to challenge age-related stereotypes).In the 19th century, a country needed youth to operate its factories, consume what they churned out and constitute a fighting force in times of war. That became less true over the 20th century, and in the 21st it bears very little relation to reality. More and more of the jobs that require stamina and strength – including fighting – are done by machines, while a nation’s products are consumed globally.Gross domestic product (GDP) might influence a nation’s geopolitical standing and a large GDP fills government coffers, but there’s no evidence that young workers are any more productive than older ones today. Twenty-somethings and 50-somethings have different kinds of intelligence, says gerontologist Sarah Harper of the University of Oxford, but both play a part in entrepreneurship. And if you care about human wellbeing you should pay more attention to GDP per person than per country.Demographer Ron Lee of the University of California, Berkeley, and others have shown that GDP per person, and hence living standards, are highest when fertility falls just below replacement level (around 2.1 births per woman) – to 1.6 or even less. When fertility is either much higher or much lower than that, quality of life falls off again. Lee would be worried if he was South Korea at 0.8 births per woman, or China at an estimated 1.3, he says, but England and Wales (1.6), the European Union (1.5) and the US (1.6) are all hovering around that sweet spot.That doesn’t mean we don’t have to adapt to the new reality. We do, in part because the way many countries distribute resources is also rooted in the 19th century and is unsustainable. More people need to work longer, for example. Although creativity doesn’t fall off with age, skills change, and we need to replenish those that are lost from the workforce. And when elderly people do finally stop being productive, we need to find new ways and new workers to care for them.Immigration – which tends to bring in young adults – is a critical component of that adaptation, smoothing the demographic transition for richer countries while redistributing capital to poorer ones where fertility rates remain relatively high. The evidence is overwhelming that, in general, immigration is good for societies – economically, but also socially. Closing doors to it is, in this sense, self-destructive.So there’s work to do, but in a world in the grip of a climate crisis, to which we’ve added 7 of the nearly 8 billion humans in just a couple of centuries – and to which we will almost certainly add another 3 billion before our numbers start falling again – it’s absurd to say that what’s lacking is babies.In fact, trying to force people to have either more or fewer babies turns out to be rather pointless. Despite China’s decades-long one-child policy, its fertility decline hasn’t been dramatically steeper than elsewhere in East Asia. France’s valiant efforts to encourage large families with financial incentives haven’t made much difference either, compared with the rest of Europe. As child mortality drops, and women’s health and education improve, fertility falls. Parents choose to invest more time, money and love in fewer children. You can sway their decisions slightly by making life harder or easier for families – through childcare provision, say, or parental leave allowances – but the demographic transition is unstoppable.The climate crisis is an interesting case, because saving the planet is often the reason people give for deciding to have fewer or no children – rather than, say, improving living standards for their fellow humans more directly – but it’s not clear what impact such decisions will have on the climate. We know the climate crisis and human population growth are linked, but not exactly how. Six births per woman is demonstrably bad for the environment, but for anything up to two the evidence is far more ambiguous. Rather than deny yourself children if you want them, Harper says, better to have one or two and raise them as environmentally conscious consumers. Policies limiting carbon emissions and plastic waste would be far more effective and timely tools for undoing or at least mitigating the damage we’ve done to the planet.Covid-19 has temporarily exacerbated the longer-term decline in fertility rates. This, too, was predictable. Familiarity breeds contempt and children, quipped Mark Twain, but only the first part holds in a pandemic. As more data comes in on this, expect more headlines about once-great nations abstaining themselves into oblivion. Don’t believe them. We do need solutions, but they don’t have to look like babies.",Opinion,Guardian
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/02/the-more-we-see-older-women-succeed-the-more-they-will-succeed,"The more we see older women succeed, the more they will succeed","Anne Robinson’s new job might not seem relevant to the average working woman, but visibility is vital to defeat ageismAnne Robinson is, as she says herself, the oldest woman on television not judging cakes.But age has hardly mellowed her. Like the canny pro she is, the 76-year-old former Queen of Mean toned it down a bit for her somewhat unlikely new gig hosting the gentle teatime TV quiz show Countdown, but the pre-launch interviews were as sharp and punchy as ever. After this long in the business, she knows her shtick. And love it or loathe it, there is something rather thrilling about her determination not to be put out to grass.This month, the US business magazine Forbes released its inaugural “50 over 50” power list of women making professional breakthroughs in later life, from the powerhouse Netflix producer Shonda Rhimes to veteran diplomat Madeleine Albright. It sparked such interest that it’s now planning more, sensing a market for something celebrating older women’s energy and creativity, instead of yet another faintly exhausting list of power brokers under 30. It’s not hard to conjure up some British equivalents. Dame Sarah Gilbert, the 58-year-old scientist behind the AstraZeneca jab, is an obvious candidate but so is the vaccine taskforce chair Kate Bingham, 55, whose knack for picking winners reflects decades of investment experience.Older women’s nous seems, for once, to be in demand in politics too. When the pollster Deborah Mattinson joins a beleaguered Keir Starmer’s office she’ll bring not just extensive research from the so-called “red wall” seats where Labour is being pulverised, but the institutional memory of someone who has known the party inside out since the 1980s, worked with Labour prime ministers, and is acutely aware that female voters over 50 (among whom Labour does badly) help swing elections. Given half a chance, she’ll help Starmer understand this often ignored group. In Downing Street, 53-year-old Simone Finn, who has been in Conservative politics since the noughties, wields increasing influence. But how does any of this help ordinary middle-aged working women, battling that toxic combination of ageism and sexism that has yet to find a catchy name, under the shadow of a pandemic?Pre-Covid, women were driving employment among the over-50s to record highs; by 2019, older female employment rates were up 15% from the millennium. But Covid hit this group hard. A Resolution Foundation analysis found lockdown had dented older women’s employment rates harder than any other major crisis since the 1980s, with Black women in particular struggling. The end of the furlough scheme this month will be a perilous time for older workers who fear being pushed into premature retirement. Yet with a bit of help from government, these don’t have to be older women’s doom years.Female employment bounced back unexpectedly strongly this spring; older women are disproportionately likely to work in health, social care and education, jobs largely sheltered from the pandemic (and Brexit) storms. Mothers’ working hours have fallen, after months of grappling with home schooling, but by January the average woman without children at home – disproportionately likely to be either under 30 or over 50 – was working more hours than pre-Covid.Some may be trying to compensate for a partner not earning, a phenomenon also seen after the banking crash when women’s work kept many households afloat. A surge of older female breadwinners would be little cause for rejoicing, if it merely masked a crisis for older men. But it may also reflect something about the women now entering middle age, raised and educated with higher expectations than their mothers. Many Generation X women have fought to hold on to their jobs while bringing up children and they can’t afford to let go now.All the supercharged role models in the world obviously won’t help without hard policy. That means a properly funded plan for social care, to stop women being forced out of work by caring for elderly parents; more flexible working towards the end of working life; specific programmes helping unemployed over-50s back into work; and better healthcare through the menopause, something the public health minister Nadine Dorries’s review on women’s health is examining.But where the Robinsons and Albrights and Binghams come into their own is as a visible counterweight to the gendered ageism that so often sees older women written off prematurely. As the saying goes, you have to see it to be it, and too many women glancing around their industries see a puzzling vacuum where the powerful over-55s should be. Any glimpse of an older woman in her professional prime represents a flicker of hope.",Opinion,Guardian
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/02/opinions/trump-organization-charges-bad-news-rodgers/index.html,This is very bad news for Donald Trump,"For months -- years, even -- legal observers have been waiting for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office to conclude its investigation of Donald J. Trump and his family business with the filing of criminal charges. Finally, the wait is over. But, in part because the indictment does not charge the former President as an individual and partly because many segments of the investigation apparently continue, these charges may raise as many questions as they answer.Thursday's charges were brought against Allen Weisselberg, the longtime chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, and against certain corporate components of the company itself, based on what is described as a 15-year scheme to evade taxes on executive and employee compensation. According to the indictment, the Trump Organization provided part of its compensation in the form of rent-free apartments, car leases, cash bonuses and private school tuition, but failed to properly account for this income, and did not pay required federal, state and local taxes on it. Weisselberg, a recipient of these benefits, allegedly also failed to pay personal taxes on this income, as part of the conspiracy.Weisselberg and the Trump Organization pleaded not guilty to the charges. The Trump Organization further called the prosecution a political ploy, saying Weisselberg was being used as a ""pawn in a scorched-earth attempt to harm the former president.""But now that this long-awaited indictment has been unsealed, what does it tell us about these charges and about the possibility of charges for additional crimes and against additional defendants?First, the charges are more serious than prior reporting suggested. Stories in the last few days undersold the case by describing it as one about fringe benefits, of the sort rarely prosecuted. While it is true that this is a case about unreported income and the failure to pay taxes on it, its scope is greater than many expected, for a few reasons. The scheme charged is a 15-year conspiracy to evade taxes, described as involving numerous Trump Organization executives and employees, only one of whom has been charged so far.The indictment alleges the commission of other crimes in addition to the scheme to defraud in the first degree, namely grand larceny in the second degree -- the second most serious white-collar crime available to state prosecutors in New York -- along with various charges for falsifying records. And District Attorney Cyrus Vance has alleged that defendant Weisselberg not only evaded New York State and New York City taxes, but also evaded federal taxes, increasing the potential tax loss amount significantly. (While state authorities cannot charge the federal crime of evading federal taxes directly under state law, they can use the federal loss amount in charging the intended scope of the scheme to violate state law, as they have done here). All of this means that this is a bigger case, and a bigger headache for Trump and his company, than what was first believed.We also know from Thursday's indictment and related proceedings that, as has been previously reported, Weisselberg is not cooperating with the investigation. And, given his central role in the charged scheme and other aspects of the Trump Organization's business that are still reportedly under investigation, he almost certainly still has a chance at a cooperation deal -- and many a defendant has changed his tune when the relatively vague notion of a potential criminal case is replaced by the cold, hard, reality of being arrested, handcuffed, fingerprinted and taken to court.But I think that Weisselberg's importance as a cooperator may not be as great as it previously seemed. Particularly given the language in the indictment pointedly describing other participants in the scheme, it appears at least possible, if not likely, that other charges will be forthcoming whether or not Weisselberg cooperates, because prosecutors either have other important witness testimony, or they can make their case using documentary evidence, or a combination of both.One thing that was not clarified Thursday is whether the other parts of the ongoing investigations will ever result in charges. Vance, the Manhattan district attorney, and New York State Attorney General Letitia James have been investigating bank fraud and tax fraud related to inflating and deflating assets, as well as the hush money payments to adult movie actress Stormy Daniels. The indictment did not shed light on these issues.While many unknowns persist, there is certainty on one point: as Trump's strong reaction to these developments demonstrates, Thursday's indictment is very bad news for the former president, with potentially much more bad news to come.",Opinion,CNN
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/28/opinions/vaccine-trials-young-children-sepkowitz/index.html,US Covid-19 response faces doozy of a challenge: Vaccinating kids,"Weeks after the US Food and Drug Administration authorized the Pfizer vaccine for adolescents, the United States hit a crucial milestone: More than half of the US population age 12 and older is now fully vaccinated..While this was a remarkable accomplishment, it was actually the easy part. The next challenge in the US vaccination program is a real doozy: vaccinating little kids.The crux of the problem is this: Do we really want to inject an entire generation of cute toddlers and grade schoolers at varying stages of immune maturity with messenger RNA -- a strand of genetic code that instructs cells in the body to make a particular piece of the virus' spike protein -- in order to prompt the immune system to mount an intense response?Well, um, sure, of course ... I'm all in. But let's be honest -- even the most vaccine-enthused among us (me, for instance) gets a bit wobbly at the knees at the thought. As a parent, my instinct is to worry, then worry some more -- but as an infectious disease specialist, I have come to trust the process.For many, the idea of performing a clinical trial in children before they are able to speak or indicate symptoms may seem concerning; however, this is business as usual in the world of vaccinology. In the past, many vaccine studies were performed predominantly in children since they are the ones at highest risk for diseases such as polio, measles and chickenpox. Thus, the methods, including how to assure informed consent, how to follow up (drawing blood can be no easy task in a 3-year-old), and how to monitor long-term safety, have been worked out.The reasons to vaccinate against Covid-19 are also compelling. First, though children usually have mild cases, sometimes they get very sick. Earlier this month, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that hospitalization rates for Covid-19 among a slightly older group of children -- between the ages of 12 and 17 -- were more than double that for influenza in the past three years. Preventing infection in this group will ultimately prevent hospitalizations.Then there is the public good vaccination will provide as we struggle toward herd protection. In the United States, there are about 50 million people 11 years old and younger, representing 15% of the total population. Though children are not substantial transmitters at home or in schools, vaccinating them will help move us closer to a normal-ish life.To overcome the collective concern and move the discussion from free-floating parental worry to real information, clinical trials of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines in children from 11 to as young as 6 months opened in March of this year.The studies are similar: About 4,500 children in the Pfizer/BioNTech study and 7,000 in the Moderna trial will receive the familiar two-shot series and then be followed for months. The placebo-controlled trials will examine three different dosages to identify the optimal vaccine strength in each of three age groups. The study will determine rates of acute Covid-19 infection, levels of antibodies, as well as short- and long-term side effects.Formal documents available indicate the trials should close next spring (2022) with fully analyzed results in 2023. However, leaders at Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna have suggested useable results may be available by autumn 2021, particularly in the 5-to-11 age group.Even with these results, the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines introduce additional unease because they use messenger RNA technology, a novel approach to vaccines that has not previously been used in humans. In the 1980s, there was a similar excitement and apprehension when the first genetically manipulated injections, called ""recombinant"" vaccines, were introduced to prevent hepatitis B. (These also may be referred to as ""recombinant DNA"" or ""recombinant protein"" vaccines and have successfully been developed against other infections.)To make a recombinant vaccine, a specific snippet of genetic material from the target virus (such as hepatitis B) is spliced into a living bacteria or yeast. Next, the bacteria or yeast is reprogrammed and directed to make millions of copies of the snippet that had been spliced in. Finally, after some high-tech processing, these little copies of the target virus snippet are injected into a person, inducing immunity. The recombinant vaccines -- which use just a snippet of the virus, rather than the entirety of a weakened or inactive one -- is in some ways a precursor of mRNA vaccines.In the 1970s, the idea of scientists working with DNA, much less injecting bits of it into people, was met by some serious resistance. People were concerned that scientists were playing with the building blocks of life and that the consequences could not be predicted. A more specific worry was that the vaccine might, by provoking the immune system, cause inflammatory conditions.Early on, researchers studied whether the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine was indeed causing an increase in cases of multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disorder. The concern was eventually allayed by analyzing large population-based data sets that revealed no causal association.Though the CDC and other authorities determined the vaccine to be safe, there are still concerns about this link. A provocative report from the United Kingdom in 2004 -- nearly two decades after introduction of the hepatitis B vaccine -- again suggested a link. Follow-up articles as recently as 2020 that analyze the presented data continue to refute it.The mRNA vaccinations against Covid-19 are likely to cause a similar back and forth that also may stretch across the decades as experts and concerned consumers debate safety. Vaccine advisers to the CDC have said the number of cases of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart, and pericarditis, inflammation of the heart lining, has been higher than expected among young people, most often males. Thankfully, the incidents are rare (the CDC researchers estimate there might be 56 to 69 cases of myocarditis for every 1 million second-dose vaccinations) and most cases are mild with symptoms that clear up quickly.It's important to note that myocarditis and pericarditis have been linked to another vaccine that did not use the mRMA technology -- the smallpox injection used in the early 2000's for young military personnel.Some of these adverse events in Covid-19 vaccine recipients were detected after study participants were more thoroughly evaluated, and the government operates a national reporting system that monitors the safety of vaccines years after they are introduced.Though arduous and at times hair-raising, this type of check and re-check and re-re-check, along with carefully performed clinical trials that examine possible early side effects, are the foundation of any worthy safety program. Still, there remains the unalterable fact that as with every scientific breakthrough, we are venturing into new territory.Which gets us back to what to do about vaccinating small children. The answer is simple: Do whatever the data shows. Actual information, not advice from computer models or experts or the newest talking heads, is forthcoming -- maybe in the fall, maybe later. If the clinical trials in younger children determine the benefits of the vaccines outweigh the potential dangers, we should administer them. And if not, we should hold back on doing so.So let's wait and see. At times, the rational, evidence-based world can be a tough place to live -- but it sure beats the alternative. And as we wait for the information, it is a great time to focus on achieving widespread vaccination of those 12 to 17 years old.",Opinion,CNN
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/23/opinions/britney-spears-deserves-privacy-alaimo/index.html,Britney Spears' lack of autonomy is chilling,"Late last month, Britney Spears told a judge she was ""traumatized"" and ""angry"" because she can't make key decisions about her life and asked for a court-established conservatorship to be abolished.Under the conservatorship, her father, Jamie Spears, has exerted control over her personal life since 2013 (other than during a 2019 break due to his health problems). He also controlled her finances until February, when a wealth management company was named co-conservator of such decisions.Of all the troubling things about this situation, one of the most problematic is that we know about it at all.Earlier, The New York Times published details from confidential court records showing that Britney Spears has long opposed this arrangement. She has said that, under it, she has been sent to a mental health facility against her will, been forced to perform with a 104-degree fever, been limited in who she has been allowed to date and has even been prevented from changing the color of her kitchen cabinets. In the hearing, she also said she was put on the drug lithium and forced to stay on birth control, as well as tour and perform against her will. This lack of autonomy is chilling.A lawyer for her father told People earlier this year that ""Britney knows that her Daddy loves her, and that he will be there for her whenever and if she needs him, just as he always has been -- conservatorship or not."")A portrait of Britney Spears looms over supporters and media members outside the court hearing concerning the singer's conservatorship at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse on Wednesday, June 23, in Los Angeles.There are so many disturbing elements here that it's difficult to decide where to start unpacking all of them. But, first, in the case of adults, conservatorships are set up when a person is not considered competent to make decisions that serve his or her own interests. This suggests that Spears continues to suffer from serious issues. Of course, it would be hard to imagine her not struggling, given the way she grew up being sexualized by the media and stalked by paparazzi.But there's also reason to believe that the conservatorship has been overly controlling. After all, during the time of this arrangement, Spears has released four albums, including two that racked up platinum sales; served as a judge on two television shows; and reportedly earned $138 million for performing in Las Vegas. As NPR points out, ""those accomplishments don't exactly line up with the typical profile of someone unable to look after themselves.""And, in November, Spears' attorney said she had stopped working and will not work again as long as her father controls her career. This in and of itself suggests the conservatorship is not working out for her.Britney fans angry at Justin Timberlake have a pointBut there's something arguably even more distressing here: the fact that we know about it in the first place. The conservatorship itself and whether it remains or has ever been the proper course of action here center on Spears' mental health and finances. These are topics that she -- and every woman (and man) -- should have the right to keep private. In the United States, the right to privacy around these concerns is so clear that the Freedom of Information Act specifically exempts private medical records and financial information from being disclosed by the government.Reporting done by the Times and other news outlets isn't illegal, but it's difficult to understand what public interest is served by digging up salacious details about a woman's private life.While Spears asked for her testimony to be made public, it's understandable after all she's endured for her to want a chance to tell her side of the story. As she said at the hearing: ""By making me keep this in for so long, it's not good for my heart. It concerns me I'm not allowed to be able to (be) heard. I have the right to use my voice.""The world simply doesn't have a right to know any of these things about Spears. But, of course, the public and media love to obsess and pass judgment over the most intimate details of the lives of women in the public eye. As Jill Filipovic (a CNN Opinion contributor) pointed out in her book ""The H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness,"" men just don't face the same ""jeweler's loupe scrutiny"" over ""every one of their life decisions.""Since Spears is an artist, we should be judging her based on her art. The fact that every fan, reporter and media commentator thinks it's his or her right to be informed of and weigh in on Spears' most personal matters is a disconcerting kind of intrusion that doesn't feel all that different from the nature of the conservatorship itself.This is why even the documentary released by The New York Times earlier this year -- which portrays #FreeBritney activists' opposition to the conservatorship and suggests the media and music industry shoulder much of the blame for many of the star's problems -- was so distressing. ""I didn't watch the documentary but from what I did see of it I was embarrassed by the light they put me in ... I cried for two weeks,"" Spears wrote on Instagram.Put yourself in Spears' shoes. The fact that she has had to contend with a setup that exerts such vast control over so many aspects of her life is dreadful enough. She shouldn't also have to consider how her plea to a judge will play in the court of public opinion. These matters should be kept confidential.What's happening to Spears also sends a disturbing message to other women: that we can't count on privacy when we engage with the legal system. It's no wonder, then, that other women often don't turn to courts for help when faced with their own chilling problems, from rape to revenge porn.No one has the right to pry into the personal health and financial details of women's lives, even if they are in the public spotlight.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/02/opinions/shacarri-richardson-marijuana-test-olympics-bass/index.html,How to do the right thing for Sha'Carri Richardson,"The initial news that US breakout star sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson had tested positive for use of an illegal substance sent sports Twitter into a frenzy. Was it steroids? Devil's Playground?It turns out, as the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) announced Friday, Richardson tested positive for something far more relatable to many folks: Carboxy-THC, a chemical found in marijuana.She with the streaming orange hair, fiery kick and a bag of emotions that she wears on her sleeve (or, rather, tatted arms) looked to be a headliner for Team USA at the Olympics in Tokyo. Beyond the gold medal that she had a hot chance to grab, she was the kind of star we haven't seen since the days of Florence Griffith-Joyner -- fast as lightning and with style and personality to match.That marijuana is a banned substance in sports seemed to take many by surprise -- and prompted some anger. How could a sprinter gain an unfair advantage using a substance known to bring about a sense of relaxation? ""If you can run that fast with weed in your system,"" one outraged fan tweeted, ""you ought to get TWO medals even before the Olympics start,"" while another quipped, ""Marijuana is not a performance enhancing drug unless you're in a pie eating contest.""Also perplexing in the case of Richardson is that the substance she tested positive for is legal in the state, Oregon, where she used it. In the United States, professional leagues, including the NBA and the NFL, have relaxed and/or eradicated testing for marijuana, and while it remains illegal on the federal level, its recreational use is allowed in 18 states and counting. What does that mean for sports, since about half of the professional teams in this country play in states that allow the regulated sale of cannabis products?The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) says it labels marijuana as a banned substance because it ""[poses a health risk to athletes, has the potential to enhance performance, and violates the spirit of sport."" Which means, yes, Richardson broke the rules. She tested positive and she has accepted the consequences -- she is owning her mistake. But at what cost? Are the rules just? Are they even logical?The criminalization of marijuana has been a central component to the deeply embedded inequities of the carceral state in America, policing Black and brown bodies and the communities they live in while exploding the for-profit prison industry. So, while Richardson -- who has taken responsibility for her actions and apologized in an interview with NBC's Today Show to her family, fans and sponsors -- might be guilty of a bad decision made just before a big race, the bigger picture of the legacy of America's so-called war on drugs should also be under the microscope.Also suspect is WADA's claim over concern for the health of athletes, in addition to its worry about unfair advantage. While the damage caused by the use of anabolic steroids is well documented -- liver damage, hypertension, violent mood swings and lower sperm count in men -- marijuana has known benefits when it comes to chronic pain. Richardson's reveal about her mental state during the Olympic trials should also be considered. She had a rough run in the days leading up to the 100-meter at the trials, when a reporter blindsided her with the information that her biological mother had died, sending her into what she called an ""emotional panic.""While tennis player Naomi Osaka walked away from the French Open in May -- and now Wimbledon this month -- to try to focus on and safeguard her mental health, Richardson stayed in the game, coping as best she could. In its official statement about the suspension, USA Track and Field promised to ""work with Sha'Carri to ensure she has ample resources to overcome any mental health challenges now and in the future.""Let's hold them to that. Because if part of these tangled and complicated doping rules in sports is really about taking care of the athlete, then let's take care of Sha-Carri Richardson. Because with her suspension, the US has not just lost the potential for a gold medal in a marquee event in Tokyo. It has lost a new star, one who created a moment for the ages when she sprinted into the stands to hug her beloved grandmother, and one who tweeted out a rainbow and had everyone buzzing about thanking her girlfriend -- whatever that might mean to her (and she will tell us if and when she wants to) -- for choosing her now iconic hair color.So now it is on Team USA to decide to name her to the team, as she would have an opportunity to run in the 4x100m relay after her suspension is over -- otherwise known as doing the right thing. And we can always use a little bit more of that in sports.",Opinion,CNN
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/03/opinions/july-4-division-unity-parini/index.html,Here's what we can all agree upon on July 4th,"The Fourth of July is a time to ask what it means to be an American and take stock of what has become of the beautiful dream of a country ""conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."" A noble vision shines there, one that we trace back to our Declaration of Independence, where equality was held as ""self-evident.""So where is that equality in the wake of Covid-19, with its devastating legacy of death and illness as well as economic and social disruption? Where does it stand amid Black Lives Matter? After thousands took to the streets to protest the murder of George Floyd and other police violence, it looked (at least to me) like the country was taking a leap forward in the gradual march toward freedom for people of color.Now, more than a year after Floyd's death, I've been reading what feel like daily news reports about state legislatures taking action to make it harder for minorities to vote. Can anyone believe that American democracy itself isn't at stake?The partisan divide grows worse. Americans have rarely been as polarized as they are today, a Pew Research study found in November 2020. On everything from the economy to racial justice, climate change and policing, it seems impossible to bridge the distance between right and left. Meanwhile, angry voices on both sides of the aisle fill our TV screens.July 4 is the time to remove the asterisk from US citizenshipIs this country just hopelessly divided? And does this cancel July 4th as a cause for celebration?Call me crazy, but I want to put forward the idea that more things unite us than divide us. We agree on many core issues: that democracy matters, that health care should be accessible, that the environment deserves a great deal of urgent attention, and that education is key for younger generations -- the next cohort to decide the fate of America. Investing in infrastructure has been a consistent wish on both sides of the aisle. Even on once hot-button topics like same-sex marriage, there has been a steady drift toward acceptance. While there is an ongoing debate about the influx of migrants at our southern border, most Americans see immigration as a good thing.The Fourth of July celebrates what happened in 1776, when the British colonies in North America asserted their independence from oppressive imperial domination. And our founding fathers were bright people with differing ideas who managed to work together to lay the foundation of our country based on shared key values. I think we can all celebrate their drive toward personal freedom, self-government and equality. The US Constitution followed our victory in the War of Independence, and it remains a durable guide to American self-governance; I've never understood the argument of the Originalists, who think it should be interpreted exactly how the authors meant. Anyone familiar with the so-called ""intentional fallacy"" in literary theory -- which suggests the author's intention can never really be known -- understands the impossibility of this desire, however noble.The Americanness that we celebrate is certainly grounded in 1776, and that's a good thing. But there is a darker side of American history -- the part about wiping out a vast and sophisticated native culture that had been here for centuries. And there was the sin of slavery. In 2019, the New York Times' 1619 project reframed American history around the consequences of slavery and the contributions of Black Americans.This upset many White people. But why can't both historical narratives be true? They are. We should teach our children about the truth of 1776 and our national drive toward liberty and equality. In doing so, we should not shrink from the ignoble sides of our story. It's possible, even necessary, for Americans to learn to accept a complex national narrative. History is not -- or mustn't be -- propaganda for one faction or another. We must confront and accommodate reality and move forward with understanding and joy to realize the dreams of 1776.In a year marked by anxiety and division, it's important to remember this July 4th that we're one nation. We believe in ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,"" and while there are many fierce points of disagreement, we remain a country founded by Enlightenment thinkers who understood that reason is itself the source of all political authority. Tolerance, progress and freedom for all are crucial aspects of Enlightenment thinking, which is rooted in constitutional government and the separation of church and state.We can all, I think, agree that all men and women are created equal. Now let's make that dream a reality.",Opinion,CNN
https://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/30/opinions/rt-foreign-agent-media-transparency-nossel-opinion/index.html,Branding news outlets as foreign agents won't make them any more transparent," the Kremlin-funded news channel formerly known as ""Russia Today,"" frequently cited as a central gear in Russia's propaganda machine -- is nothing if not colorful. The network is known for declaring the Boston Marathon bombings a government plot, publicly shaming its own journalists if they dare defy the Kremlin line and for featuring American commentators known for conspiracy-mongering.Now RT can add another ignominious label to its long list: foreign agent.Following years of hue and cry over the network's overt pro-Kremlin bias, earlier this month the Department of Justice forced the channel to file under the ""Foreign Agents Registration Act,"" or FARA, a 1938 law that was initially passed to counter pro-Nazi propaganda and subsequently retooled in the 1960s to publicly pinpoint those lobbying on behalf of foreign interests.Forcing RT to register as a foreign agent is justified, but isn't the best way to counter the propaganda the channel -- or any other source of disinformation for that matter -- puts out. While RT has howled its objections, the network may protest too much. Absent a far wider effort to incentivize and enable news consumers to distinguish serious news and analysis from agitprop, FARA registration or not, the influence of RT and other shady news sources may survive intact.The problem is that while RT's FARA registration may make members of Congress and administration officials feel as though they've landed a blow in the fight against Russian propaganda, RT's filing with the Justice Department may well never register with most news consumers. From the looks of things there is no easy way for a consumer of RT to learn that it has filed as a foreign agent. It is not mentioned in the ""About Us"" section of RT nor flagged on RT stories that appear in Google searches. The same is true of the China Daily News, a media outlet long registered under FARA as an agent of the Chinese government.News cognoscenti are already well aware of RT's lineage, but to get through to those who read and believe the network will require more than the fine print in a government filing.Former FBI Director James Comey put it bluntly in testimony last March before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, saying, ""The Kremlin is waging an international disinformation campaign through the RT propaganda network which traffics in anti-American conspiracy theories that rivaled the extravagant untruths of Soviet era Pravda.""In late October Twitter announced that it would ""off-board"" all advertising from RT and Sputnik, another Russian-controlled platform, based on its own investigation and on US intelligence agencies' conclusion that the networks had sought to influence the outcome of the 2016 election at Putin's behest.Whereas FARA contains an exception for bona fide media organizations, those state-owned entities that have qualified for it -- including the BBC and Germany's Deutsche Welle -- have strong layers of publicly visible and reputable independent governance that shield editorial decision-making from government interference.While critics have been hard-pressed to argue that RT does not meet the criteria for registration under the act, they have rightly pointed out that by enforcing its provisions against the network, the US will likely trigger a wave of retaliatory and copycat measures designed by governments to clamp down on media outlets considered unfriendly. Indeed, the Russian Duma, acting at Putin's behest, moved swiftly to pass its own version of foreign media registration requirements last week. Russia's Ministry of Justice has let US government-backed networks, including Voice of American and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) know that they may be required to register under the new act. Russia is also reportedly considering more sweeping bans on the availability of foreign print media.In some ways, these new measures are old news: US government-backed VOA and RFE/RL have been blocked from broadcasting in Russia for years. The more worrying prospect is that repressive regimes elsewhere in the world -- think the Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte or Uzbekistan's Islam Karimov -- are emboldened in acting to foster local distrust of credible international media outlets.With consumers accessing the vast majority of their news via Facebook and other social media feeds, the likelihood that news of RT's filing will color the reception of its stories among those who currently tune in seems dim. Tangible indicators of likely veracity -- including information about the news source, its track record, ethical guidelines and reporting methods -- can be ferreted out only through time-consuming research, if at all. A study earlier this year by the Media Insight Project revealed that consumers are far more likely to evaluate the veracity of a news article based on who shared it than what the source is.If anything, worries about RT's influence point to the fact that transparency in American news media consumption cannot come solely, or even primarily, through force of law. Rather, we need Americans to be trained and educated to expect and demand transparency about ownership, editorial control, potential conflicts of interest and internal checks and processes to preserve objectivity and accuracy from the news that we consume. And, if outlets insist on remaining opaque on these fronts, as has RT, we should know to reject those outlets as unreliable.We should prize voluntary transparency by news outlets, and should refuse to pay for, devote our attention to, do business with and share information from outlets unwilling to be transparent. As primary conduits for news, social media platforms have an essential role to play in equipping and empowering users to get the information they need to make sound judgments about what they're reading and sharing.In an open media ecosystem, especially as one as large and freewheeling as the internet, government regulation is never going to be a satisfactory answer for the scourge of fraudulent news or propaganda.Ultimately, the best defense against fake news and foreign propaganda lies in comprehensive public education on the uses and misuses of media. News literacy curricula in schools and workplaces, easier-to-use reference material tied to news shared online, transparent newsroom policies on subjects like conflicts of interest and corrections and rigorous methods of sourcing and crediting are all essential to enabling news consumers to navigate the information ocean in which many now drown.It is true that Americans are fiercely independent in choosing what media to consume and credit. But no one wants to be fooled. Rather than consoling ourselves that RT's motives and loyalties will now be laid bare, the network's belated registration under FARA is just one more reminder that absent more far-reaching action, purveyors of propaganda and fraudulent news will likely continue to work their will on a populace that is ill-equipped to defend itself.",Opinion,CNN
https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/lizoyer/coronavirus-incarcerated-vaccines,I’m A Public Defender. My Clients Keep Getting COVID-19 While Incarcerated.,"As a public defender, my job is to represent poor people charged with crimes. I’ve always had many clients behind bars. But the wall between us was never impermeable until COVID-19 hit.Before the pandemic, I visited my jailed clients several times a week. I advocated for them in courtrooms. I worked their cases zealously. When COVID hit, my legal practice came to a screeching halt. Jail visits were abruptly cut off. The courthouse was shut down. As I huddled at home with my family, my clients were essentially sealed into mass isolation within the jail. I felt like I was riding away in a lifeboat, leaving everyone stuck on the ship to sink.None of my clients got sick immediately. Initially, it seemed like the fact that they were isolated from the rest of the world, albeit in miserable conditions, might keep them safe. But staff enter and leave the jails every day, so it was only a matter of time before COVID crept in. When the virus first hit one of our pretrial detention facilities in the spring, it spread like wildfire through the crowded quarters. Our clients were effectively trapped in a burning building.Everything I learned in three years of law school and 15 years of practice suddenly seemed completely useless. I filed motion after motion, trying to get people out of jail — and trying to ease my conscience. I had very little success. The pandemic created a sort of Catch-22: Clients at institutions still COVID-free were deemed ineligible for release because the danger to their health was not sufficiently imminent. And clients at institutions with active outbreaks were deemed unsafe to release because of the risk they might carry COVID into the community.As I spun my wheels, more and more of my clients got sick.In June, a healthy, 43-year-old client I’ll call Alan tested positive for COVID at a jail in Baltimore. He had no symptoms, but was shipped out to Hagerstown to be put in isolation. There, Alan was quarantined in a tent with other prisoners who had tested positive. Alan spent 13 days shackled to a bed in that tent. He was required to urinate in a bed pan. He had no access to a shower. He was not even allowed a phone call to his family to let them know he was alive.I cannot overstate how stressful this time has been for families of incarcerated people. Visitation has been suspended and jails have been abruptly locked down, limiting communications with the outside world. Family members — whose hearts are in there with their loved ones — are left for days and sometimes weeks at a time imagining the worst.In October, a 53-year-old client I’ll call Robert was nearing the end of his sentence at a federal prison in Fort Dix, New Jersey, when his roommate became ill with COVID. Prison staff sent the sick man back to the six-person dorm where he shared a bunkbed with Robert. The men were instructed to sleep “head to toe” to reduce the likelihood of transmission. When the prison finally tested the other men, days later, all had COVID. Unsurprisingly, this was just the start of a much larger outbreak: Nearly 1,500 of the 2,500 inmates at Fort Dix have now contracted COVID-19.If a nursing home or hospital managed an outbreak this way, criminal investigations would follow. But when prisoners’ lives are at stake, we seem content to apply lower standards.By November, all I could think to do was put money on the commissary accounts of the clients I’d tried and failed to get out, as well as the clients I knew I wouldn’t be able to get out. MoneyGram made a fortune off my guilt; they charge $8.95 per transaction to send money into federal prisons!I finally won compassionate release for a client this week. It took five months and eight court filings. He’s 36 years old and has end-stage kidney failure. A doctor told the court he would likely die if he got COVID. I planned to pick him up from the prison in North Carolina. But the Bureau of Prisons put him on a bus before I could get there: a 10-hour ride with four stops in the middle of a pandemic.We continue to incarcerate more people, even as jails and prisons are uncontrolled breeding grounds for this virus. At the federal pretrial detention facility in Baltimore, where many of my clients are housed, one-third of the population has tested positive for COVID since January. The facility is now scrambling, reactively, to take basic precautions that should have been in place many months ago. While Maryland has prioritized vaccinating residents of nursing homes and other congregate facilities, no vaccines have been offered to my clients, who are equally at risk.It has often been said that a nation’s greatness is judged by how it treats its most vulnerable members. We have tools to protect incarcerated people, including compassionate release, home confinement, clemency, and, now, a vaccine. We must use these tools unsparingly — or history will judge us harshly for it.",Opinion,Buzzfeed
https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/shannonkeating/amy-coney-barrett-and-the-weaponization-of-white-motherhood,Amy Coney Barrett And The Cult Of Conservative White Womanhood,"This week’s Senate confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barrett, Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, feel very different from the Kavanaugh spectacle of 2018.The biggest distinction, of course, is that Brett Kavanaugh, the first of Trump’s nominees to make his senatorial case for a seat on the bench, was credibly accused of sexual assault. Those hearings were extraordinary. Raw. Kavanaugh, red-faced and raging, remains “indelible in the hippocampus” to so many assault survivors who watched the vile pageantry unfold before us those few days, we who have grown up in a society in which boys’ feelings and ambitions are so often prioritized at girls’ expense.Judiciary Committee Republicans were eager for a more “civil” process this time around. In his opening statement earlier this week, Sen. John Kennedy described 2018 as a “freak show,” choosing a head-scratching metaphor: “It looked like the cantina bar scene out of Star Wars.” Not only were emotions then running sky-high on both sides of the aisle, but protesters had flooded the hallways surrounding the hearing room, some of them wearing the red robes of handmaidens; others sought out senators in other halls of government and pleaded with them to consider their experiences, going viral as a result.This year, the coronavirus pandemic has left those halls silent. What’s more, as Intelligencer’s Ed Kilgore points out, “this time the nominee’s character and personal background are assets, not handicaps.” While both nominees were Roman Catholics and Federalist Society members, Kilgore writes, “Barrett’s background has served as both shield and sword for her proponents in a way that Kavanaugh’s did not.” Though Republicans tried defending Kavanaugh as a family man, a “father of daughters” — referencing his time as a girls basketball coach — it wasn’t to nearly the same effect.Conservatives have long accused Democrats of harboring anti-Catholic bias against Barrett, as they claimed was the case during her 2017 hearings for a spot on the 7th Circuit. It’s a clever move for Republicans, who can cry religious bias should any Democratic senators try to investigate any possible connections between Barrett’s ardent faith and her views on, say, abortion and marriage equality. (The faith group with which she’s associated, People of Praise, opposes abortion and expels members for gay sex; Barrett also gave talks to anti-abortion groups in 2013, which she initially failed to disclose to the Senate ahead of her hearing.) The other, perhaps more significant part of her personal background that works quite nicely as both sword and shield: Barrett is a mother. And not just any mother, but a mother who works, returning at the end of the day to a house of seven children, two of whom were adopted from Haiti.Nearly every Republican senator during the hearings mentioned Barrett’s large brood in an awe-inspired way. She is “remarkable,” the senators told her — a “superstar.” Barrett, for her part, has embraced the supermom narrative. She brought most of her large family to watch the hearings and made clear on the day of her nomination that while she’s a judge at work, she’s “better known back home as a room parent, carpool driver, and birthday party planner.”Conservative pundits and columnists have crowed that the hysterical, naggy Democrats weren’t able to ""Kavanaugh"" a superwoman. The glorified, even fetishized ideal of conservative, religious white womanhood made Barrett an ideal candidate, even before she was memed for not taking any hearing notes, supposedly evidence of her brilliance.The two Republican women on the committee went so far as to insinuate that Barrett’s Democratic critics were, in fact, being anti-feminist in daring to oppose her nomination. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa told Barrett that the Dems were “attacking you as a mom and a woman of faith” with accusations that are “demeaning to women … that you, a working mother of seven with a strong record of professional and academic accomplishment, couldn’t possibly respect the goals and desires of today’s women.”Ernst’s implication, that being a mom with a job makes Barrett a friend to women, regardless of how her jurisprudence affects their lives, is exactly the kind of narrow reading of feminism anti-feminists would like to promote: one that encourages prolific motherhood for some while stigmatizing it for others; one that would force women into unwanted childbirth, then abandon them and their children once they’ve left the womb; one that disregards the unearned privileges and social forces that allow some women to thrive while keeping others in a state of precarious struggle; and one that points to the advancement of certain individual women as evidence that gender discrimination does not exist.This is the conservative savvy of a pick like Barrett: “She is the perfect combination of brilliant jurist and a woman who brings the argument to the court that is potentially the contrary to the views of the sitting women justices,” Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion political group, told the New York Times last month. Even though, by 2020, we should know better than to assume that a single representative of a demographic will always best represent that demographic, Democrats would have to tread carefully were they to so much as insinuate that Barrett, a woman, might not ensure the best futures for most (nonwhite, non-Christian, not straight or cis, not financially comfortable) women, a majority of whom want to keep abortion legal.So too were Barrett defenders able to wield her motherhood status when it came to where she stands on racial justice. Earlier this week, when Sen. Cory Booker asked her if she condemns white supremacy — noting that the president who appointed her has failed to do so in a straightforward way — he was slammed on the conservative internet for what was apparently a deeply offensive question, given that, as the Blaze and many other conservative outlets pointed out, Barrett is the mother of two Black children. (She answered Booker in the affirmative.)Though the grown children of transracial adoption will readily tell you that being the adoptive parents of kids of color doesn’t magically make white people not racist (and can even help mask their racism), it’s automatically assumed of white, partnered, religious mothers — in the way it isn’t for Black mothers, or single mothers, or poor mothers, many of whom tend to be vilified rather than lionized — that they can do little wrong.Samuel Corum / Getty ImagesThe daughters of Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett look on as she testifies during her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, on October 13, 2020.To be clear, I don’t know anything about what kind of mother Barrett is, and in all likelihood she’s a good and loving parent. But she’s given the benefit of the doubt in the way that I can’t at all imagine a single Black mother of seven children would have. What’s more: It’s assumed that her particular brand of motherhood would actually make her a better justice. To deflect Democratic worries that Barrett’s confirmation could threaten the status of the Affordable Care Act, which has occupied a large chunk of the hearings, Sen. Charles Grassley suggested that “as a mother of a seven, Judge Barrett clearly understands the importance of healthcare.”Meghan Daum, who’s written extensively about the stereotypes leveled against childless women, wrote in her column for GEN this week that both Barrett and vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris, who’s frequently emphasized her role as a stepmother and aunt, or “Momala,” on the campaign trail, are evidence of an “assumption ... that female leaders can’t really be trusted unless they’re mothers. Or, at the very least, they can’t be trusted by campaign strategists to be relatable to the public at large.”“It’s that tightrope that women have to walk that men don’t,” Christine Matthews, a Republican pollster who focuses on female voters, told the New York Times in a story this week about the “freighted expectations for women” holding public office. Men typically aren’t subjected, as Barrett and so many other working mothers have been, to questions about how they can possibly do it all. (Barrett has mentioned that her husband does “more than” his fair share of work at home, and that they have “friends and fearless babysitters” helping out. While we don’t know her specific arrangements, other families of means tend to employ other women, often women of color, to do a lot of the gruntwork of childrearing behind the scenes, and they’re typically overworked, underpaid, and subjected to a constant state of precarity.) Still, Matthews noted, Barrett seems well primed to walk that rope. “The Republican members of the judiciary are introducing her as a legal titan who drives a minivan. They are in some ways daring Democrats to step all over a minivan mom.”Now that the hearings have ended, all signs point to the minivan mom emerging triumphant. The national outrage that swelled during the 2018 hearings is more or less absent now. To be fair, it’s 2020; everybody’s exhausted and pretty much confined to their homes. And we don’t have a figure like Christine Blasey Ford, whose testimony about the sexual assault she experienced as a teenager gave a sense of real, human gravity to Kavanaugh’s confirmation.During the Barrett hearings, Democrats have trotted out anecdotes and photos of constituents who are terrified that they’ll lose their healthcare — the Supreme Court will be hearing a case about the Affordable Care Act a week after Election Day — but the most powerful image to have emerged from this week has been that of Barrett herself, brandishing her empty notepad or else simply sitting there, withstanding hours of questioning, so very close to becoming the youngest justice on the bench. At 48, she has the power to shape American law for decades.While the mood of these hearings might be a lot more “civil” than 2018’s, the stakes couldn’t possibly be higher. If confirmed, Barrett will cement a 6–3 conservative majority on the court, making it, according to one Washington Post analysis, the most conservative SCOTUS since 1950. Not to mention that Republicans have, in classic fashion, violated their own precedent against ramming an appointment through during an election year; meanwhile, millions of Americans are desperate for immediate relief during a catastrophic period in American history, and unlike Amy Coney Barrett, they’re just going to have to wait for whatever cruelly underbaked stimulus package manages to eke by in the Senate.Booker was among the more passionate Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee, making clear that he didn’t see all this as another business-as-usual hearing in which the Dems play by the rules that Republicans set and, when it suits them, are all too happy to break. During his opening statement, Booker condemned the “charade,” repeating that “none of this is normal and we cannot normalize it.”But sounding the alarms over what a great existential threat Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation would be to healthcare, abortion rights, and LGBTQ rights (to name a few) isn’t easy when besmirching the purity and goodness of Christian white womanhood is treated as a grievous sin in this country — far greater a sin, according to conservatives, at least, than leaving millions uninsured, or condemning pregnant people to illness or deepening poverty if they’re forced to give birth against their will, or denying trans children the right to lives free of harassment and violence.The supposed moral purity and goodness of white motherhood has consistently enabled conservatives who’ve combined large families with high-profile careers, like Sarah Palin and anti-ERA activist Phyllis Schlafly, to carry out the extraordinarily damaging work of white supremacist patriarchy in a prettier, more feminine package. Barrett, with her “near-perfect performance” at this week’s hearings, is only the latest in a long, long line of white women whose pleasant, down-home family values have successfully masked her ability — and her will — to do extraordinary damage to families that don’t look like hers.",Opinion,Buzzfeed
https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rinacummings/amazon-warehouse-was-grinding-me-down-then-coronavirus,Working At The Amazon Warehouse Was Always Painful. Now It's Terrifying.,"Even before the coronavirus hit, going to work at an Amazon warehouse already felt like I was risking my health. Standing on your feet for 12 hours at a time and performing repetitive motions while sorting boxes takes a toll on your body. By the middle of my shift, my joints throb with pain and sometimes my fingers become numb. I know my body is asking me to take a breather. But the clock doesn’t stop ticking, and I can’t make rate if I take a break.In the first few weeks after COVID-19 came to New York City, the warehouse operated as usual. People started getting sick, and we knew it, but Amazon wasn’t giving us any information. The company said it sent people who were confirmed to have had contact with the virus home with pay, but most people who were sick weren’t able to get tested. And we know many people who were sent home still haven’t received pay. We kept working, standing next to each other on the floor of the sorting department, in the break room, and on the crowded buses taking us to the warehouse.I have been out on medical leave for a few weeks, choosing not to go into work to protect myself and my family. Amazon let us have unlimited unpaid time off (UPT) last month, but that’s not an option anymore. We either have to go to work or quit, which would risk eligibility for unemployment.I worry about catching the coronavirus when I go back to work. The company has now staggered our shifts, so there are fewer people. But there’s no real social distancing in the warehouse. We get gloves and masks, but we have to keep wearing them over and over again because the supply is nowhere near enough. When I get home from work, I jump in the shower right away, even before hugging my kids, because I don't want to spread the virus. Amazon doesn’t pay me for the extra time it takes for me to sanitize everything that went to work with me, or the extra loads of laundry I am running to keep everything clean.I am a single mom with two beautiful children. Right now, my kids are home from school. When I can afford to, I’ll pay for a babysitter — but mostly my 15-year-old takes care of my 2-year-old when I go to work. My shift is 12 hours, overnight Thursday through Sunday.From my coworkers I organize with, I’ve heard that things are busier than ever in the warehouse. Every day during COVID-19 feels like the week before Christmas. Amazon is making a killing from this crisis. Almost literally. Jeff Bezos’s net worth has grown by more than $24 billion since the crisis started since everyone is at home trying to avoid going to the store and ordering everything online. But none of that money is going to workers. I have more expenses now than before, buying masks, gloves, and cleaning supplies; doing more laundry; paying for childcare; and trying to do everything I can to keep life as normal and happy as possible for my kids. And I don't know what I’ll do if I get sick.When Amazon workers, including some of my coworkers, have spoken out about unsafe conditions and demanded the facility be shut down and sanitized after positive COVID-19 cases were identified, some have been fired in apparent retaliation.We just learned yesterday that an Amazon executive resigned over the unfair firing of whistleblowers who are trying to keep themselves and their workers safe. Amazon doesn’t need much of an excuse to fire us; it happens all the time. Anyone can be fired without any notice or reason — being a few minutes late, getting written up for not making rate, demanding more gloves or masks. My elderly coworker was fired over voicemail for leaning on a stopped belt on a break. Management said he was sitting while he should have been working.I can’t afford to get fired, so I’m on my toes all the time to make sure that Amazon doesn’t have an excuse. I live just 20 minutes from the warehouse in Staten Island, and I usually take the bus to work. My commute should be easy, but it easily turns bad. The buses coming from the ferry often skip my stop because they are jam-packed with Amazon workers. When that has happened in the past, I take a $50 Uber to work to avoid being late and having an hour deducted from my UPT. There is a lot of fear from workers that Amazon will terminate you if you use too much UPT, which makes everyone stressed about getting to work on time.Time is everything at Amazon. I’ve developed digestive issues since I’ve been working there because I have to shove food down my throat and then run back to my station. A robot will write me up if I am late. It doesn’t care whether I had my lunch or not. It doesn’t care if I am coughing, or if I faint at my station, or if someone else sneezes on me. They just count the rate of how many packages I sort.I am a human. Not a machine.I learned that the New York City Council is considering legislation that would require big corporations like Amazon to pay extra during this crisis to compensate us for the increased risks we are taking on and make it harder for them to fire us on a whim. Going to work is a health hazard during this crisis, but we need the money, and people need to get the supplies we are sorting. A bit more pay and some job security would ease a lot of stress. They say we are essential, but Amazon treats us like we’re expendable.",Opinion,Buzzfeed
https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/shannonkeating/bernie-sanders-identity-politics-democratic-primary-2020,Bernie Sanders Is A Straight White Man. Does That Matter?,"During the Las Vegas Democratic presidential primary debate last month, former mayor Pete Buttigieg — who yesterday dropped out of the race — accused Sen. Bernie Sanders of a failure in leadership when it comes to reigning in his army of supposedly toxic supporters.“I think you have to accept some responsibility and ask yourself what it is about your campaign in particular that seems to be motivating this behavior more than others,” Buttigieg said.It was Sen. Elizabeth Warren to whom the question about Bernie Bros was first directed, and to her credit she didn’t opt to smear the diverse coalition of progressive voters working to elect Sanders — likely realizing that they’re potential constituents who value many of the same things she does. Instead, she pivoted to point out who, in her view, was the biggest threat on that stage to Democratic unity and progress: former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. But for other candidates, the opportunity to pile on the Democratic frontrunner for the actions of his most visibly and vocally aggressive followers — who, granted, probably aren’t Russian bots, as Sanders has insinuated — was too good to pass up.After Buttigieg got in a few jabs, the Vermont senator pointed out (correctly) that the black women involved in leading his campaign are also victims of “vicious, racist, sexist attacks” from other candidates’ supporters. Though they’d rather not admit it, every single candidate in the race has been able to claim quite a few asshole surrogates and supporters (including Buttigieg!).It is true, however, that Sanders’ fans — of whom there are many, especially the young and Very Online — are particularly loud on social media. Sanders has wholeheartedly condemned the harassment and bullying carried out in his name since the “Bros” first became a problem for him back in 2016, after which his top aides privately reached out to senior officials at opposing campaigns to apologize for the sexist and racist swarms. Still, by this point, the Bro narrative has been rather exhaustively overhyped, to the extent that the campaign insists it’s become a distraction and a smear.Particularly because he’s an old white guy — and a cranky one, at that — Sanders is frequently assumed to inspire the worst and most bigoted impulses in the people who support him, regardless of their own race and gender. One Sanders skeptic claims he is “a man who defines himself around his anger, and he attracts a lot of men who define themselves around their anger, many of whom do, in fact, use it as a license to act abusively.” Another explains his rapidly expanding, diversifying base with the theory that “some young women and some young people of color want to be more like angry white men.” Bernie fans who aren’t men must have “internalized misogyny,” this theory goes, while his many supporters of color have “internalized white supremacy.”When (white male) identity and its resultant “toxic masculinity” is assumed to be the driving force of a candidate’s campaign, it follows that a woman candidate would offer something radically different. Amy Klobuchar, who has reportedly run “a workplace controlled by fear, anger, and shame” in which she “demeaned and berated her staff almost daily, subjecting them to bouts of explosive rage and regular humiliation,” even went so far at the Las Vegas debate as to suggest that we could stop sexism on the internet by nominating a woman for president.The whole exchange in Vegas perfectly illustrated how a certain brand of neoliberal identity politics, popularized in the Obama era, feels increasingly insufficient to address the most pressing issues of our time. We might all agree, for example, that social media has contributed to the poisoning of our political discourse. But to imply that a woman Democratic nominee in 2020 would stop or even slow sexism (online or otherwise), when Hillary Clinton’s candidacy did nothing of the kind, strikes me as more than a little delusional.A significant subset of progressive Democrats still cling to the hope that, going into the 2020 elections, presidential identity politics might save us.Thanks in part to the promotion of marginalized identity representation and visibility in the United States, more women and people of color have leading roles, top jobs, and other positions of power than they did a generation ago — which, proponents argue, means positive trickle-down effects for everybody else. But any feminist or civil rights gains afforded by the efforts and visibility of, say, more women CEOs or queer politicians haven’t necessarily made significant differences in the lives of those on the margins. That isn’t to say power should stay in the hands of old, rich white guys, but that even as the pool of leaders (in everything from entertainment to publishing to politics) has grown slightly more diverse, discrimination and bigotry remain everyday facts of life for millions of Americans. Many nonwhite, nonmale people do make it a priority to raise up others when they ascend to powerful positions, but just as many others pull the ladder up behind them.Even our first black president, some black activists and thinkers have argued, fueled the false hope of a post-racial era. Critics have pointed out how Barack Obama prioritized a politics of individualized “racial uplift” rather than one of systemic anti-racist change, and received undue celebration from pundits who preferred to overlook the less savory parts of his record “in the name of racial symbolism,” as Cornel West wrote in 2017. Obama’s historic presidency, for all its allegorical power, did not in fact result in a post-racial America — nor did Hillary Clinton’s candidacy solve systemic sexism or stem the tides of gendered violence. But a significant subset of progressive Democrats still cling to the hope that, going into the 2020 elections, presidential identity politics might save us.I understand the urgency undergirding so much of the push for representation and why, for example, Warren supporters are so heartened by the idea of a smart and organized woman as president, especially since she’s so often been undermined for misogynistic reasons, or why Buttigieg supporters felt passionately that his campaign was a huge symbolic win for queer rights. Both have faced real institutional barriers because of who they are, which can sometimes translate into the belief that, after so much bigoted pushback, it’s simply their turn, regardless of what either of their platforms would mean for the country.But if anything signals what should be the beginning of the end of identity as a primary metric of candidate selection in Democratic politics, it’s the rise of Sanders and his grassroots, multiracial, intergenerational movement to empower working-class people. For the Brooklyn native and many of his supporters, his identity is beside the point. If Americans elect someone who believes in universal human worth and dignity and refuses to compromise on fundamental issues, then maybe — maybe! — we might actually get closer to something like a ""post-identity"" reality than we could ever manage through symbolic representation.One of the latest reported instances of Sanders’ supporters running amok involved attacks against the leaders of the Nevada Culinary Workers Union after they criticized Sanders’ Medicare for All plan, because it would effectively eliminate the union’s hard-won private insurance. Buttigieg mentioned the feud in the Vegas debate, hoping to paint a picture of a Sanders coalition that viciously attacks anyone who doesn’t believe in his platform. But that storyline didn’t stop the senator from dominating the polls; in fact, members of the Culinary Workers Union themselves bucked leadership by backing Sanders in the Nevada primary, contributing to his victory there. According to the New York Times, “many rank-and-file union members said they supported Mr. Sanders precisely because of his health care proposal, explaining that they wanted their friends and relatives to have the same kind of access to care that they have.”This is something that seems to get overlooked in the focus on the most extreme and aggressive end of a wide spectrum of Bernie stans: Behind so many of his supporters’ vehement anger at unchecked corporate greed is a deeply compassionate impulse of solidarity with other people in this country, regardless of what they have in common and what sets them apart. And that is very much by design; as my colleague Ruby Cramer wrote in December, Sanders is aiming to run “a presidential campaign that brings people out of alienation and into the political process simply by presenting stories where you might recognize some of your own struggles.” So it’s disorienting to watch a parade of supposed political experts and pundits scaremongering about how Sanders’ and his supporters’ rage is divisive, even as he continues to amass a strong multiracial and cross-class coalition.I don’t think someone who works for the Sanders campaign should be shitposting about opponents, even on a locked account, like former staffer Ben Mora — if only because the senator’s critics are all too ready to pounce on an example of his movement’s supposed toxicity — but I don’t think private insults made by a lower-rung staffer are necessarily newsworthy, either. For one thing, barely a quarter of American adults use Twitter, where a lot of the Bernie Bro hysteria is centralized. And for another, Sanders is reportedly the most-liked candidate in the Democratic field, according to a recent poll from FiveThirtyEight and Ipsos. Most voters, it seems, are comfortable making a distinction between the worst of the so-called Bernie Bros' behavior and the platform of the candidate they support.I feel similarly about the claims that Sanders is too loud, too angry, too much (which are also leveled, for sexist reasons, against Warren). In Sanders’ case, the accusations carry with them whiffs of anti-Semitism, alongside the troubling insinuation that anger is somehow an inappropriate reaction to the current state of inequality in the US. But they also reflect an attempt to position Sanders as an avatar of the patriarchy.Projecting individual trauma onto entire communities or movements, made up as they are of an incredibly diverse array of humans, does a disservice to us all.Sady Doyle, an author and prominent figure from the mid-aughts feminist blogosphere, recently tweeted that she associated Sanders’ yelling with the horrific treatment she endured from her father growing up, and that Bernie’s movement “enacts dynamics of abuse.” Likening Sanders, and, by extension, his supporters, to a violent misogynist becomes a frustratingly self-fulfilling prophecy; a number of cruel and vitriolic responses (which seemingly proved her point) no doubt made it easier for Doyle and others who agree with her to brush off the reasonable, good-faith criticism she also received.I’d wager Sanders’ supporters are largely aware of the debilitating effects of misogyny, if not experiencing it firsthand. But what overly simplistic readings like “Bernie = Man = Bad” elide is the many complicated ways in which different kinds of people experience gendered violence. Since time immemorial women have terrorized black people of all genders; cis people have terrorized trans people of all genders; the combinations go on and on. Those who feel triggered by the tenor and volume of Sanders’ voice — to the extent that they’d seriously struggle to vote for him over Donald Trump — resonate on the same frequency, to me, as women who’ve experienced male violence and thus refuse to share space with trans women. That’s not to say their trauma is negligible or excusable, but that projecting individual trauma onto entire communities or movements, made up as they are of an incredibly diverse array of humans, does a disservice to us all.Earlier this year, some similar projection occurred when the question of whether Sanders had privately expressed doubts to Warren that a woman could win the presidency became the topic of public debate. As Natalie Shure wrote for Elle at the time, “the impulse to cast Sanders and his supporters as sexist — intended as a sharp contrast with the feminists behind Warren or Hillary Clinton before her — is based on an analysis of politics as a pop cultural product. In this telling, Warren is the beleaguered underdog heroine, taking on just another old white guy finger-wagging his way to the top. This obfuscates the structural power at work and the degree to which many people are drawn to Sanders’ candidacy for decidedly feminist reasons: In a starkly unequal country with a woefully inadequate welfare state, women disproportionately suffer the harms of poverty.”Ultimately, Shure wrote, “#MeToo doesn’t urge us to uncritically accept a female presidential contender’s version of a news story; it urges us to take seriously women’s pain and fight for them to have control over their lives — and no one, least of all victims of sexual violence, is served by collapsing that moral distinction.”To some extent, it’s understandable why Sanders makes such a tempting blank canvas for projecting identity narratives, since the candidate largely refuses to narrativize his identity himself. He doesn’t talk much, for example, about the fact that, if elected, he would be the first Jewish president in US history, though he’s done so more this election cycle than he did back in 2016. (He’s also recently been referring to himself as the “son of an immigrant.”) That’s one of the reasons his recent remarks at a New Hampshire town hall about how his Jewish heritage influences his politics and worldview struck such a chord; a clip of the exchange has been viewed over 1.5 million times.While other candidates like Warren and Biden “often invite you to consider your story through the lens of their own,” as Cramer wrote in her profile of Sanders late last year, the Vermont senator would rather not use his personal life to connect with voters. “You’re asking about me, and I’M not important,” he once said in an interview. To Cramer, he added, “The gamble is there are millions of working people who don’t vote or consider politics to be relevant to their lives. And it is a gamble to see whether we can bring those people into the political process. One way you do it is to say, ‘You see that guy? He’s YOU. You’re workin’ for $12 an hour, you can’t afford health insurance — so is he. Listen to what he has to say. It’s not Bernie Sanders talking, you know? It’s that guy. Join us.’”To his supporters, Sanders’ refusal to center himself in his campaign makes it clear that he views himself as a mere vessel for a movement that’s much bigger than one person or one presidency. In many ways, the campaign does traffic in more conventional identity narratives — the focus is just on other people’s identities: those of his campaign staffers and those of potential voting blocs. Surrogates like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez can speak to Sanders’ platform as it’s relevant to different minority communities with personal and cultural specificity, while black campaign leaders like Briahna Joy Gray and Nina Turner emphasize how much of Sanders’ movement is actually shaped by, and for, black women.Sanders himself is well aware that, on the level of optics, he himself is not an ideal messenger. (At a recent CNN town hall, when asked about a VP pick, he said, “That person will not be an old white guy. That I can say definitively.”) And so the campaign emphasizes the senator’s history of movement ties and support — the people are leading him, rather than the other way around. Were he to become president, Sanders has said he would be acting as “organizer in chief.”In some ways, of course, Sanders’ universalism with a focus on labor isn’t anything new; every successful presidential candidate has sold the American people on some broader vision, from Obama on hope to Trump on making America great again. And it’s hard to believe anyone vying to become one of the most powerful people on earth when they tell us it’s not really about them. And yet, with the slogan “Not Me, Us” (an active rhetorical reversal of Hillary Clinton’s “I’m With Her”) Sanders has fashioned a campaign built and backed by people of all genders, races, and socioeconomic classes who don’t necessarily see themselves in him as an individual — perhaps because they don’t really need to.Even though former vice president Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are old white guys, for example, the former’s overwhelming black support in South Carolina won him his first primary in that state over the weekend; meanwhile, a recent poll shows that the latter has just overtaken Biden in support among African Americans nationally. Of course, at this point, voters are selecting from an all-white field — but even earlier in the race, black voters weren’t necessarily flocking to support black candidates.Sanders is rarely given representation credit for his ability to speak to people who also know what it’s like to live paycheck to paycheck.I think often in this never-ending election cycle of Zoe Leonard’s landmark poem, “I Want a President,” written the year I was born. “I want a dyke for president,” Leonard writes. “I want a person with aids for president and I want a fag for vice president and I want someone with no health insurance and I want someone who grew up in a place where the earth is so saturated with toxic waste that they didn’t have a choice about getting leukemia.” No matter how many times I read it, the poem can still leave me teary-eyed; it’s weighted with so much crushing impossibility.Because even if we one day do have a “dyke” or a “fag” for president — or a woman, for that matter — it seems impossible that we’ll ever see someone in the White House who truly represents people currently living beneath the poverty line. There have been presidents who grew up in economically precarious situations, and Sanders could potentially join their ranks, but even the sole democratic socialist candidate had to first become a millionaire in order to make it this far.That’s the strange thing about class. It’s possible to live your whole life in the same socioeconomic bracket — indeed, as the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, class ascendance is becoming a rarer feat — but it’s also possible to slip into and out of poverty. Like disability, class isn’t as stable an identity as those of race or gender (though race and gender aren’t necessarily stable either). And like sexual orientation, it’s not always possible to look at someone and determine their family’s present or past household income — which is one of the reasons why, when discussing identity in US politics, Sanders is so rarely given representation credit for his ability to speak to people who also know what it’s like to live paycheck to paycheck.What’s remarkable about the senator’s campaign is that he drives home the fact almost all of us, save the very rich, are a single medical issue away from complete financial ruin. For all our many differences, this is a grisly reality the working people of this country have in common. Though conservatives and moderates who fear the rise of democratic socialism love to try gotcha-ing Sanders for his “hypocrisy” because he owns a lake house, or target his surrogate Ocasio-Cortez when she wears sparkly tops or gets an expensive haircut, the fact that some people have more disposable income doesn’t preclude them from advocating for a fairer distribution for all. And those of us who’ve managed, against the odds, to ascend from the working poor to the middle class are not under any illusions that being able to buy a nice dress today means we’ll never again have to fear losing our jobs and therefore our health care tomorrow.Voters who are more progressively minded but still think Sanders’ focus on class is too singular tend to worry his campaign isn’t “intersectional” enough, especially when compared with Warren’s. Last month, the Nation published an opinion piece (since corrected and updated) by professor Suzanna Danuta Walters claiming that Warren is the “first intersectional presidential candidate.” The story includes as examples of Warren’s “intersectional framework” her ability to link gun control to domestic violence, or criminal justice to disability rights. But she’s not the only candidate who can lay claim to a platform that concerns multiple intersecting identities and oppressions. Sanders’ plan for a Green New Deal, for example, prioritizes “Justice for frontline communities — especially under-resourced groups, communities of color, Native Americans, people with disabilities, children and the elderly — to recover from, and prepare for, the climate impacts.”And if some people are claiming Sanders can't serve the interests of multiple different identity groups or communities he doesn't belong to, a lot of the people in those communities beg to differ. Barbara Smith — who along with other members of the black women–helmed Combahee River Collective coined the term “identity politics” — expressed dismay earlier this year in the Guardian that she so often sees “support for identity politics and intersectionality reduced to buzzwords.” Smith was writing to endorse Sanders for president: “because I believe that his campaign and his understanding of politics complements the priorities that women of color defined decades ago.”Smith directly addresses the intersectionality concern: “Some critics have questioned whether Sanders is concerned about the specific ways that people with varying intersecting identities experience oppression. As a black lesbian feminist who has been out since the mid-1970s, I believe that, among all the candidates, his leadership offers us the best chance to eradicate the unique injustices that marginalized groups in America endure.”Critic Andrea Long Chu, in response to the Nation’s piece about Warren’s supposed intersectionality, nailed in a Twitter thread what’s so frustrating about assumptions that Sanders isn’t as strong on issues of race and gender: The piece, she wrote, is “v specific to academic feminists who have so convinced themselves that universalism is a luxury of the elite that when a candidate amasses a broad working class coalition with universal rhetoric their brains pop. … like do i think bernie sanders really knows what a trans person is? no. nor for that matter does liz warren. but trans people need health care way more than they need some politician to give them a nice vibe. … there’s real humility to universalism insofar as it doesn’t predicate public goods on visibility or representation. Bernie doesn’t have to ‘see’ you in order to defend you. it’s impersonal in a way i find respectful.”Where critics of Sanders find evidence of potential erasure in his universalist appeals — that any moment he discusses the working class in general is a moment when he’s not specifically addressing the concerns of black women or mothers or trans people — his supporters see a radical and widespread commitment to economic justice regardless of who they are.All of this is not to say identity can’t, or shouldn’t, play any role in an individual politician’s narrative. Sanders, even if his personal life remains his campaign’s B plot at best, still has the power to connect with voters by speaking to his Jewish identity and his upbringing in a rent-controlled Brooklyn apartment. Ocasio-Cortez, too, has made a powerful case for issues she cares about, like a $15 minimum wage, by couching political discussions in her experience as a waiter and a member of the working class. And Warren, in the last two primary debates, has proven to be a formidable Bloomberg opponent by brilliantly connecting her own ordeals of discrimination in the workplace to the indignities allegedly suffered by women under Bloomberg’s employ. She pushed him to release three women from their NDAs in a matter of days. Warren quoting on national TV the horrible things Bloomberg has reportedly said about women made a very strong case for electing someone who intimately understands what it feels like to be harassed, belittled, and violated due to one’s gender.Attempts to politicize the personal can just as often be a liability as they are an advantage.But Warren’s candidacy has also shown us the downsides to an overreliance on identity narratives. More than 200 Cherokees and other Native Americans just signed a letter urging Warren to fully retract her dubious past claims to Native heritage, including her reliance on a DNA test that she publicized last year. Warren has previously apologized, and recently reiterated those apologies in a 12-page letter, but the claims continue to haunt her. Neither is relying on the identity of high-powered surrogates a safe bet; the New York Times, in a recent story about how Warren is winning black activists but losing the black vote, Astead W. Herndon reported that “the progressive activists who have showered her candidacy with validation have a different electoral lens than the black electorate at large. That schism is a distinction some have labeled ‘grass tops vs. the grass roots’ — or the belief that the leaders of liberal and progressive organizations have a different political lens than their more working-class members.”Which is all to say that attempts to politicize the personal can just as often be a liability as they are an advantage — a risky game that Sanders, in his refusal to frame his campaign around his identity, has largely decided not to play.As a straight white man, even a socialist Jewish one, that’s without a doubt in part a function of his privilege. Most nonwhite, nonmale candidates don’t have the option of making a campaign Not All About Them. Sanders — for all that the Democratic establishment might be doing to try to prevent him from clinching the nomination — does benefit from looking like the “default” political candidate in a way a black person or a woman simply doesn’t. But if you have a built-in strategic advantage in building this kind of universalist campaign, you might as well use it.Earlier this year, the publishing world’s equivalent of the identity politics debate centered on the novel American Dirt, about a mother and her son fleeing violence in Mexico for the promise of the US. The book, which was criticized for its harmful stereotypes of Latinx immigrants, was written by a woman who until recently identified as white. In a Twitter thread in the wake of the controversy, writer Kaitlyn Greenidge posed an excellent question: “What if the aim of your art is not to humanize the other but to talk about the systems of power, and the ppl who benefit from them, that turn people into others in the first place? Like what if you asked your audience to take it for granted that someone poorer than them is also human and then moved on from there.”I wonder if Sanders’ campaign might be employing something similar: taking for granted the fact that all of us, regardless of our race or gender or socioeconomic status, are human, and therefore deserving of certain rights: clean water, a roof over our heads, freedom from crippling college debt, medical care that won’t sink us into bankruptcy.Sanders, like any politician, is not a saint or a savior. To many of those who harbor serious doubts about the fundamental value of electoral politics and the structures that govern our society, a vote for him at the end of the day is still harm reduction, still a way in which we are choosing our enemy. And universalism, at its most basic level, is the biggest cliché in the political handbook: We are all more alike than we are different. But anyone still clinging to the hope of identity representation might do well to remember that. ?",Opinion,Buzzfeed
https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/australia-bushfires-climate-change,My Country Is On Fire. Soon The Whole World Will Be.,"Australians are incredibly angry right now — at their leaders, at their media, and at themselves. I went home over the holidays and found a country whose biggest cities were under a haze of smoke and whose population was undergoing a reckoning — one that wasn’t just political, but philosophical.It feels as if the country is finally opening its eyes. Nature, a scientific journal, has dubbed our bushfire crisis “a wake-up call,” and people are indeed now grappling with fundamental questions: What will the next 50 years look like? The next 100? What will their own lives look like? And just what did they do — or rather not do — to contribute to all this mess?In Australia, climate change is no longer an abstract problem that future generations will inherit — it’s a problem for those here and now. There’s no going back from this — something environmentalists have warned for decades, but many are only learning now through personal experience. This realization is going to drastically reshape Australia’s political and economic consciousness in the years ahead — especially as younger generations gain more influence.Since returning to the US last week, friends and strangers keep asking about the fires. Even the surly customs officer who stamped my passport brought them up. But I’ve also been fixated on what it will take for Americans and the rest of the rich world to have their own ""come to Jesus"" moment? And by that point, will it simply be far too late?The horrible secret truth about Australians is that we’ve always desperately craved attention from the rest of the world. The little brothers of the West, we yearn for nothing more than your respect. It’s about pride, certainly, but more than that it’s about validation — acknowledgement that we’re not being ignored down here on the far side of the world, that you see us, that we exist.We can be righteously indignant that international media outlets tend to overlook our successes and scandals — of which there are many — often focusing instead solely on stories about kooky or dangerous animals. That’s when we’re making the news at all, mind you. It took until 2017 (2!0!1!7!) for the New York Times to finally open a bureau in Australia. Even then, it dubbed the country its “next frontier” and described its first reporters there as “pioneers.”Well, we have your attention, at last.After decades of exporting to the world a vision of a carefree and sun-kissed Aussie quality of life — “the Lucky Country!” we like to call ourselves — our international image is suddenly going up in smoke. A tourism advert starring Kylie Minogue and targeting British holidaymakers with a cheery vision of Australia has been pulled from the air “in light of the current situation.” Tennis players at the Australian Open in Melbourne are collapsing on live TV, unable to breathe properly. Hollywood stars are offering condolences on awards show stages. Headlines around the world have proclaimed the deaths of more than 1 billion animals.I could smell the smoke as soon as I landed in Sydney. You can smell it in New Zealand and South America. When the doors of my Qantas plane opened and I stepped onto the jet bridge, I was met with the unmistakable scent of my country ablaze.I left the airport and found a country I barely recognized: Blankets of smoke on the streets of inner Sydney that were so thick on some days that you couldn’t see to the end of the road. People wearing masks as they made their way to work. Evening news broadcasts packed with apocalyptic scenes from down south, where the fires were raging worst: darkness in the middle of the day, children under bloodred skies, unimaginable death and destruction.Everywhere I went, the fires were the main topic of conversation. Friends told me they were having trouble sleeping, wide awake at night thinking about loved ones in danger zones or simply worried about Australia’s future. At my cousin’s harborside wedding in mid-January, we led a thankful toast for the heavy rain that had arrived to drench the celebrations. It was the first anyone could recall in months.Most stark, though, was the change in political tenor. A conservative government that had surprised everyone — including themselves — by romping to victory just seven months before in an election dominated by discussions of taxes on investment properties was now very much in the fire zone.People were floored that the prime minister decided to vacation in Hawaii amid the disaster, but the real fury went deeper. A leader who two years ago brought a lump of coal to the floor of Parliament to mock his left-wing opponents — “Don’t be afraid! Don’t be scared! It won’t hurt you!” — was suddenly being pilloried for his lack of any real climate policy. Even the opposition leader was shamed for his continued full-throated embrace of the coal industry. Yet, for now, it’s politics as usual. The government has shown no intention of substantial policy change, or even a skerrick of shame over its intransigence.I keep returning to how David Wallace-Wells described my country in The Uninhabitable Earth. “By far the richest of all the countries staring down the most intense, most immediate warming barrages,” he writes, “Australia is an early test case of how the world’s affluent societies will bend, or buckle, or rebuild under the pressure of temperature changes likely to hit the rest of the well-off world later this century.”For decades, Australia has been the world’s coal mine.

https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kateandrias/opinion-how-to-make-every-job-a-good-union-job,How To Make Every Job A Good Union Job,"Cierra Brown works at a McDonald's in Durham, North Carolina. She earns little more than minimum wage, and even with a second job at a local hospital she can’t afford health insurance and pays for her diabetes medication out of pocket. She is frequently asked to stay late and close the store, hours after the bus stops running. If she complains, she knows she could lose her job — and nothing would change anyway.She’s far from alone. More than 40% of US workers make less than $15 an hour. Amid this national crisis for the working class, support for unions has risen to its highest level in 50 years. But our current labor laws make the protections of a union virtually impossible to obtain for Cierra and tens of millions of other workers like her.If you’re a lawmaker who wants to dramatically improve the lives of US workers, fixing those broken laws should be at the top of your to-do list. The solutions are well known and already used in democracies around the world — including virtually everywhere in Europe. And they would work here too, not just for fast-food workers like Cierra but for the Uber drivers, warehouse staffers, home care workers, and on-demand delivery drivers who are being employed in ever-greater numbers in today’s economy.The core problem facing these workers is that our current labor laws only require organizing and bargaining to be done at the individual worksite. In order for Cierra to win a union contract, for example, a majority of the workers at her McDonald's outlet would need to vote to unionize. But there’s so much turnover, it’s hard to know who works at the restaurant. Meanwhile, their boss has made clear he’s against a union, and they know from other workers’ experience that if they file for a union election, they’ll likely face illegal threats and maybe even firings. Even worse, McDonald's corporate would not be required to join the bargaining, nor would workers at other McDonald's locations be allowed to join.In a better system, workers across the fast-food industry would be covered by a sector-wide bargaining agreement. Their employers would no longer need to compete by lowering wages and reducing benefits to match the most worker-hostile company in their sector. Instead, competition would be based on the quality of their products or the excellence of their services.Our current system has profound shortcomings: First, worksite-by-worksite bargaining creates a major incentive for employers to fight unionization in order to avoid having to pay higher wages than their competitors. Second, it encourages corporations to outsource work to nonunion contractors or to classify employees as independent contractors. Third, it creates divisions between the lucky workers who belong to a union and those who do not, making it harder to win better conditions for all workers.A system that provides rights to all workers across a given sector, not just everyone at one worksite or one franchise, solves these problems. The many democracies that already have such a system have far greater collective bargaining coverage than the United States does. Not surprisingly, researchers have found that broad, sector-wide collective bargaining coverage tends to reduce economic inequality.Sectoral bargaining is particularly effective at raising wages and benefits in industries that are highly fissured, and ones with high numbers of independent contractors. In the US, those are the industries in which women, people of color, and immigrants are disproportionately represented — yet another reason why this system would promote deeper social equality.A consensus is building for such a system here in the US. Clean Slate for Worker Power, a coalition of more than 80 participants from labor, academia, and nonprofits, convened out of Harvard Law School’s Labor and Worklife Program, today released a set of sweeping recommendations to fundamentally rewrite US labor laws. The report calls for sectoral bargaining, as well as other proposals that would help shift the balance of power in this country back into the hands of working people like Cierra.Why push for such reform now? We can’t afford to wait. Our country is suffering from staggering economic inequality, in large part because of the decline of the labor movement. Unions redistribute wealth — from owners to workers, from rich to poor. Their decline explains why we now lack a check on concentrated economic power. It also explains much of the current crisis of political inequality. As wealth gets more and more concentrated, elites build greater and greater political power; they translate that into favorable policies that make them even richer.When unions were strong, they not only helped limit the concentration of wealth, they also engaged millions of everyday people in the political process; that in turn helped ensure the government was responsive to the needs and desires of low-income and middle-class people. The decline means working people have lost their most effective voice in our democracy. And it explains the mounting problems in working people’s everyday lives — not just low wages, but unpredictable schedules, dangerous working conditions, and too many employers who fail to treat their workers with dignity and respect.History shows us that when workers join together and form their own organizations, they’re able to counter the power of corporations, with game-changing results for our economy and society. Our legal system must enable working people to build those organizations and use them effectively. The time has come for a system of bargaining for all.",Opinion,Buzzfeed
https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-07-08/electric-vehicle-goals-charging-deserts,What it will take to get electric cars into low-income communities?,"The California Energy Commission said in June that the state needs about 1.2 million electric vehicle chargers in public and shared private locations, such as office complexes and multi-unit dwellings, to meet its mandated goal of putting 8 million zero-emission passenger vehicles on the road by 2030.With just 73,000 or so public and shared chargers available today, that means the number of chargers statewide would need to increase by about a factor of 15. An expansion of that magnitude in a period of nine years cannot be achieved if current patterns persist in terms of who buys electric vehicles and where charging stations are built.To accelerate EV adoption and meet the state’s goals, electrification must happen more equitably and profitably. Currently, most electric fast-charging stations in Los Angeles are located in neighborhoods where residents can afford electric vehicles; by contrast, areas where average incomes are below $50,000 are often “charging deserts.”The problem is that the public charging network for electric vehicles has been designed to serve early adopters — the drivers who can afford the higher upfront cost of an electric vehicle. But if developers of charging stations wait for more charging demand to emerge organically, lower-income communities will continue to be left out and the state’s goals for vehicle electrification will remain out of reach.Fortunately, economic and policy factors are beginning to align in ways that could catalyze the development of a much larger EV charging network that works for everyone.First, electric vehicles are becoming increasingly affordable, driven in part by a rapid drop in battery costs. The upfront cost of some EVs may reach parity with their gasoline-powered alternatives as soon as next year, according to the latest research from BloombergNEF. Meanwhile, the first generation of long-range, lower-cost EVs such as the Chevrolet Bolt and Tesla Model 3 are starting to change hands as they come off lease or the original owner sells.These cars create a market for used EVs that has been almost nonexistent to this point. As new and used EVs become more affordable, a wider swath of drivers will be able to buy them, generating demand for public charging in the areas where they live and work.Second, under the new California Clean Miles Standard, rideshare companies such as Uber and Lyft must begin electrifying their California fleets in 2023. And by the end of the decade, 90% of ridesharing miles in the state must be electric. The Clean Miles Standard adds regulatory pressure to the companies’ own pledges for electrification.A recent analysis from RMI of 101 million rideshare miles showed that rideshare drivers of electric vehicles currently have to leave their neighborhoods and operate in wealthier neighborhoods where the public charging stations exist. And according to Lyft’s statistics, 46% of Lyft rides start or end in low-income areas, which means there’s plenty of demand for ridesharing inside these communities to support an electric fleet if public charging stations exist.The Clean Miles Standard necessitates investment in charging infrastructure everywhere, but especially in lower-income communities that are underserved by the existing charging network. This would also spread the benefit of reducing local air pollution by replacing internal combustion engines.Electrifying vehicle fleets is crucial in part because each vehicle sees much more use than a personal vehicle does. A 2020 study by Alan Jenn of UC Davis found that electrifying a single Uber or Lyft vehicle yields the environmental and emissions benefits of electrifying about three private vehicles.By electrifying en masse, a vehicle fleet can also change the economics of charging on a large scale. RMI’s analysis found that the charging network in L.A. will have to grow by a factor of three to six just to support electrified ridesharing fleets.With ridesharing drivers as anchor customers, we found that a robust, widespread charging network can quickly reach profitability for station operators. In our analysis, we focused on direct-current fast chargers — the stations where drivers can recharge on the go — which are especially important for fleets that need to minimize vehicle down-time. They also benefit lower-income drivers generally, who may not have access to private charging at home or work. But despite the promising economics, the build-out of fast charging is still challenging, with frequent permitting delays, complex regulatory processes and other costs.These barriers will need to be eliminated for California to reach its electric-vehicle, climate and air quality targets. Policymakers can direct public funds to provide better access to charging in low-income neighborhoods and a more inclusive transportation system overall. And utilities must ensure that their rate structures do not discourage the development of new EV charging stations. For instance, fees based on peak power usage can be prohibitively expensive for fast-charging stations.Alternative solutions include a short-term “holiday” from these charges, or a sliding-scale approach that phases them in to allow stations to build up a steady base of utilization and revenue.If California can spur the growth of a broad and equitable charging network, it will provide a model for the rest of the country by building a cleaner, more sustainable future for transportation.",Opinion,LA Times
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/07/07/4-day-workweek-japan-iceland-wellbeing-productivity/,We’re making the wrong argument for a four-day workweek,"“We mean to make things over, / We are tired of toil for naught, / With but bare enough to live upon / And ne’er an hour for thought.”Workers sang that song in the 1880s, protesting for an eight-hour workday at a time when the average was more like 12. They achieved that goal. But more than 100 years later, we’re still singing the same song.Today, it’s the four-day workweek that’s gone from fringe idea to pragmatic policy consideration. Japan is recommending it in its economic policy guidelines. Iceland instituted a trial program that went swimmingly. And Spain is working on its own plan.The push for a shorter workweek was already gaining traction before the pandemic. But covid-19’s upending of office life has made it seem more plausible than ever — perhaps even necessary. Companies have realized that their hastily adopted flexible work policies can help attract and retain employees, and workers have proved they can adjust to radical shifts in their working lives.Yet we keep thinking about work in a disappointingly narrow way.Even as companies, activists and individual workers champion the idea of a shorter workweek, they’re framing it in old terms. We can get all our work done in four days, we promise. In fact, we’ll be more productive. (Look at Microsoft Japan, which famously increased productivity by 40 percent!) No more unnecessary meetings. No more interruptions from our nonwork lives. After a three-day weekend we’ll be rested and recharged — the better to hit the ground running on Monday morning!It’s not that we want “an hour for thought” — it’s that working fewer hours will make us better workers. But this isn’t radical change. It’s the same old profit über alles dogma packaged in a more tightly compressed box.When we focus on how a shorter workweek will make us better employees, we’re making the wrong argument to our bosses and ourselves. The four-day workweek shouldn’t just be about becoming more productive — the real benefit is that it would allow us to be fuller people.So why not discuss the four-day workweek in those terms?In an admittedly unscientific survey, I asked Twitter followers whether they would prefer a regular four-day workweek or a month’s vacation — and why. Over 500 people responded. And nearly 85 percent wanted the shorter week.Some clearly wanted the convenience of an extra weekend day, the ability to run those pesky errands that are constantly pushed out of reach by the ever-expanding workday. (Truly, whose idea was it to have the DMV close at 4 p.m.?)But most said the four-day week would give them more time to do the things that make them … themselves. Some wanted to pursue a skilled pastime that would enrich their lives, such as playing an instrument or making art. Others thought they would spend the extra day with their friends and families — describing it not as drudgery or “child care,” the exhausting task that has pulled mothers especially from the workforce, but quality time. There was mention of various hobbies and associations, of going to museums, taking walks, spending time at church.These sorts of activities are unlikely to be recognized as creating economic value. But they’re obviously rich in human value: the mastery of a craft, a connection created with others, an embeddedness in a particular community or place. These are the things that make us whole. Yet without enough free time, one can’t develop the relationships and commitments we need to truly thrive.The United States has for decades been locked into an economic mind-set in which growth, or at least its potential, is seen as the main barometer of success, and individuals are judged mainly on what we produce. In the elite classes in particular, work has become central to our lives, a source of meaning and status. We’re proud of our ability to work hard and efficiently, even though our gains in productivity haven’t accrued to us personally.But the push for a four-day workweek suggests we do have other things we value — as we should. The trick will be learning to advocate for them on their own terms, with the same clarity and fervor with which we celebrate material and economic gains.“We mean to make things over,” those 19th-century workers sang. In the 21st century, making over our conversations — the ways we measure worth and the value we place on our own well-being — will be a big part of getting the job done.",Opinion,Washington Post
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/07/06/supreme-court-inches-closer-press-freedom-showdown/,The Supreme Court inches closer to a press freedom showdown,"At the Supreme Court, today’s lonely dissenting opinion sometimes grows into tomorrow’s constitutional law. Examples include John Marshall Harlan’s stand against the “separate but equal” doctrine in 1896; Harlan Stone’s defense of Jehovah’s Witnesses’ conscientious objection to flag salutes in 1940; and William Rehnquist’s campaign for state sovereign immunity in the 1970s.So take note of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch’s 11-page dissent on the last day of the just-completed term, in which he argues that the court should have heard a challenge to its 1964 landmark holding in New York Times v. Sullivan.For more than half a century, the Times precedent has protected press freedom — and the robust public debate that it enables — by making it extremely hard for public officials and public figures to win libel suits against the media. The Times decision permits even untrue and defamatory statements as long as they were published unintentionally or at least without “reckless disregard” for the facts.It would take the votes of four justices to revisit that and, as of July 2, when Gorsuch’s opinion appeared, there are two. The first was Justice Clarence Thomas, who advocated a Times reconsideration in a 2019 solo opinion (technically a concurrence, not a dissent) and did so again in a companion dissent to Gorsuch’s, asserting, per his “originalist” judicial philosophy, that Times was a Warren Court invention with no basis in the Constitution’s text or the common law.This was an improvement over the hyperbolic dissenting opinion last March from Laurence Silberman, a conservative senior judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, in which Silberman rebuked his colleagues for dismissing a libel suit and blamed the Times precedent for fostering Democratic “one-party control of the press and media”— even though Rush Limbaugh enjoyed its protections, too.But Gorsuch’s opinion, smartest of the three, adopted a more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger tone. It focused not on the alleged bias of all-powerful networks and newspapers but on the hapless inability of these financially challenged legacy news organizations to uphold journalistic standards as they compete for clicks with upstart social-media rivals.“What started in 1964 with a decision to tolerate the occasional falsehood to ensure robust reporting by a comparative handful of print and broadcast outlets has evolved into an ironclad subsidy for the publication of falsehoods by means and on a scale previously unimaginable,” Gorsuch writes.Like other Times critics, Gorsuch acknowledges the 1964 case represented the court’s attempt to meet a real threat: Alabama’s corrupt deployment of expensive libel lawsuits to silence the New York Times and other northern papers covering the state’s brutal crackdown on the civil rights movement.Yet even those of us who agree with the result in Times, who felt outrage at President Donald Trump’s demagogic attacks on reporters as “enemies of the people,” and who believe in maximum freedom of expression, can acknowledge Gorsuch’s point that Times has had unintended consequences, some of which “leave even ordinary Americans without recourse for grievous defamation.”How else to describe McKee v. Cosby, in which one of Bill Cosby’s sexual-assault accusers tried to sue him for allegedly smearing her through leaks to the press — only to have her complaint dismissed on the grounds, derived from precedents that began with Times, that her own accusations against Cosby had made her a ""limited purpose public figure”?Such distinctions are rapidly losing intelligibility in a world where, as Gorsuch points out, anyone can become Instagram-famous “overnight.""These conservative jurists’ views are hardly surprising, given the right’s hostility toward the “mainstream media.” Interestingly, though, Gorsuch’s opinion draws heavily on a new law review article by professor David A. Logan of the Roger Williams University School of Law, which bluntly faulted Times for “frustrating a basic requirement of a healthy democracy: the development of a set of broadly agreed-upon facts.”Gorsuch also alludes to Byron White’s second thoughts about Times and to a 1993 article by then-law professor Elena Kagan, in which she noted that Times had perhaps inappropriately extended protection to stories about “celebrity gossip"" and ”the private and sexual lives of political figures."" The liberal Kagan, now Gorsuch’s court colleague, never went so far as to call for overturning the precedent, but Gorsuch’s point — misgivings about Times are not exclusive to the political and legal right — is well taken.If and when the justices do reassess Times, the press may have fewer friends in court, relative to 1964. Out of court, too: Just 40 percent of the public expresses trust in the news media, according to the Gallup poll, with Republicans most antagonistic.A detailed survey by the Media Insight Project, released in April, traces disenchantment not to partisans’ belief that media are biased against them but to more general “skepticism about the underlying purpose and mission journalists are trying to fulfill in the first place.”Journalists surveyed by the project believed that ""a good way to make society better is to spotlight its problems.” And in 1964, the Supreme Court elevated that journalistic article of faith to constitutional principle. Today, according to the Media Insight Project, only 29 percent of the American people agree with it.",Opinion,Washington Post
https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kareemshaheen/the-muslim-worlds-nightmare-decade,The Muslim World's Nightmare Decade,"As the US prepared to invade Iraq in the winter of 2003, my father and I were in Mecca, taking part in the annual hajj pilgrimage. We surged with a great mass of humanity in the millions to pray atop Arafat, the mountain of mercy. We slept under the open sky on the pebbles strewn throughout Muzdalifa, a plain near the holy city. Before the hajj we had taken evening strolls in Medina, the Prophet Muhammad’s city, often walking by Shia worshippers chanting mournful hymns by the resting places of his family and companions in the Baqi’ graveyard.I was 17 at the time, and I am still bewildered at how quickly it all unraveled, how thoroughly that momentary sense of unity and fraternity was destroyed in my mind in the immolation that followed. Throughout the Arab world, and in the Muslim world beyond it, the 21st century — and particularly its second decade — will be remembered for the litany of catastrophes that devastated entire nations and struck at the very idea of the moral arc of the universe.It is too easy to elucidate these tragedies. They are too numerous, their enormity only more alarming in hindsight. The Muslim caliphate, an idle dream colored by myths of former glory, was resurrected in a brutal and fevered nightmare of atrocities piled upon crimes against humanity. The emergence of ISIS and the horrors it wrought will likely spell the end of ideologically driven political Islamist movements in the Middle East, much like the crushing defeats of the 1967 war undermined pan-Arab nationalism.A nine-year civil war in Syria with half a million dead undermined every international norm in warfare, from the targeted bombing of hospitals to the use of chemical weapons. It fueled the largest mass migration since World War II, and the rising tide of right-wing populism across the globe, whose uniting force is anti-Muslim hatred. The governments of the world’s two most populous countries launched sweeping projects to question the legitimacy of hundreds of millions of Muslim citizens and break their spirits. Revolutions gave way to crushing tyranny throughout the Middle East, the tyrants themselves turning against each other in a cold war that destroyed the idea of any kind of shared destiny. New forms of injustice are invented every day.But the broader, collective tragedy was the cruelty and enmity among supposed brethren. There is an exuberance in inflicting torment and suffering that goes beyond the traditional and practical zero-sum politics of exclusion in the Middle East, whether it is the Orwellian joy of launching military operations with monikers like “Operation Olive Branch” and “Restoring Hope,” the enthusiastic and vindictive mass murder or incarceration of political opponents in countries like Egypt and Turkey, the brazenness of chopping up a journalist inside a consulate, or the vulgarity of a political discourse in which every day is a witch hunt.One hadith or recorded saying by the Prophet Muhammad goes: “The parable of the faithful in their affection, mercy, and compassion for each other is that of a [single] body. When any limb aches, the whole body reacts with insomnia and fever.” It could not be less true today. As an Egyptian saying goes, “those who had modesty are dead.”But as I write this, my son is 7 months old and two things give me hope for the world he was born into. First, while western powers and foreign influences played an important role in setting the stage for conflict, the worst excesses of our tyrants, be they presidents and kings or preachers and evangelists, are products of our own societies. The invasion of Iraq created an environment where ISIS could flourish, but its chieftains and ideologues are very much our own. So there is hope for change from within. And secondly, an experiment has begun that could declaw some of these tyrants.A few months ago Ayed al-Qarni, a prominent Saudi cleric with a huge following in the Arab world, apologized in a television interview for espousing a harsh and austere brand of Islam. “I apologize to Saudi society for the mistakes, [for the] harshness that contradicted scripture and the forgiving nature of Islam, that moderate, centrist religion that is a mercy to all mankind,” he said.Al-Qarni claimed his apology was a result of his personal growth and development. But he also acknowledged the real source of his rebirth by praising Saudi Arabia’s powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. Among other things, the crown prince is responsible for Saudi Arabia’s disastrous war in Yemen and the humanitarian crisis it created, an unprecedented crackdown on Saudi activists and moderate religious clerics, and, according to the CIA the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. He also initiated a series of dramatic social and religious reforms in the kingdom, from opening entertainment venues to ending gender segregation in restaurants, eliminating many of the guardianship rules that denied agency to Saudi women, and trimming back the power of the clergy to police society and public behavior.To outsiders, many of these reforms may seem archaic, shallow and symbolic, an anachronism in our era. But anyone who grew up under the influence of the harsh and austere religiosity exported throughout the Muslim world by the Saudi state via its clerics and oil wealth knows just how significant this change in direction could prove to be.Al-Qarni and his ilk have a lot to apologize for. The roots of violent jihadism are too complex to be laid solely at their feet, although they certainly deserve their share of the blame. But for many Muslims, their legacy is both deeper and harder to define: the absence of joy and a harshness that permeated one’s vision of religion in total opposition to the mercy they have now belatedly discovered. It is a legacy seen in the absence of mothers, daughters, and sisters in family photographs, their covered faces retreating into the background in malls and markets. It's the judgment in the eyes that look upon a woman whose hair cascades down her back for all to see or a man listening to music in his car, the harsh cut in the film reel where the kiss was supposed to be.The desire to resurrect a past of fundamental purity may have reached its most violent and deranged form in places around the globe where this Saudi influence was strongest, but it’s not unique to the Muslim world. Across the West, right-wing xenophobes preach anti-immigrant nationalism centered on reclaiming a mythical original social purity. Salafism is a similar reaction to an increasingly complex, depressing modern reality filled with defeat, oppression, lack of agency and disruptive, imported social trends. It harkens to a simpler, mythological time, one in which heroism is possible and dignity is a straightforward choice, where the right thing to do is as clear as a white thread against the night sky.The problem, of course, is that like every imagined utopia, this one wasn’t real and never will be. Only 20 years after the Prophet Muhammad’s death, a rebellion toppled the caliph, who was the prophet’s son-in-law, and rival claims to leadership led to fratricide and civil war whose legacy endures almost 1,500 years later. Its participants, then and now, accuse one another of treason, apostasy, and treachery over their competing visions of society.Saudi Arabia has begun to loosen the tyrannical hold over society enjoyed by the clerics who imposed what they considered a true Islam. But to truly atone for its evangelical embrace of puritanism and its propagation throughout the Muslim world, it must champion reform and dialogue across the diverse mosaic of tradition, mysticism, and sect that encompass the global Islamic experience. It must give way to voices of moderation and inclusion that can take the lead in reforming religious education.A new era for the Muslim world would deemphasize the purist obsession with minutiae and rituals, and emphasize the overarching moral codes of egalitarianism and compassion that are at the core of Islamic teaching. It would embrace the critical thinking that was key to the Islamic Golden Age, which kept the flame of progress alive in the Medieval era.Saudi Arabia may never atone for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the devastation it wrought in Yemen, its torture of women's rights activists or its destabilization of the Arab world. But whether we like it or not, the country holds the keys to a peaceful reformation that could have far reaching impact on generations of young Muslims.My son will grow up in a multifaith household where we will celebrate Christmas and Eid, paint Easter eggs and eat sugar-dusted pistachio pastries during the Feast of Sacrifice. In an era of great uncertainty and monumental change, I will teach him to never be bewildered by the multiplicity of paths to the Divine. We must take comfort in the fact that it’s impossible to get lost along the way.",Opinion,Buzzfeed
https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/salvadorhernandez/surfside-miami-apartment-collapse-recovery-no-survivors,Crews Are No Longer Looking For Survivors In The Rubble Of The Surfside Condo,"For almost two weeks, crews have sifted through the rubble of the collapsed Champlain Towers South apartment building in Surfside, Florida.Amid the ruins, they've unearthed 54 bodies, but officials now say there are no signs that any survivors might still be found.On Wednesday, officials announced they are ending their search and rescue operation and instead shifting to recovery efforts in hopes of finding the bodies of the 86 people who are still unaccounted for.""At this point, we have truly exhausted every option available to us in the search and rescue mission,"" Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava told reporters.Early in their search, officials said they had detected sounds like banging under the steel and concrete debris — a hopeful sign.By Tuesday, however, fire officials said they no longer heard any sounds or saw any indications that there were still survivors in the wreck.Crews have used sonar, cameras, dogs, and heavy machinery in their search, Cava said, working against fire, smoke, and torrential rain.Rescuers had looked for ""livable space,"" for example, but were ""not seeing anything positive that continues in that space,"" Miami-Dade County Fire Chief Alan Cominsky told reporters Tuesday.After assessing the wreckage and other factors, officials said Wednesday that the chances of anyone surviving in the rubble are ""near zero.""""Today's news is extremely tough for all of our search and rescue professionals,"" Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said. ""We've all worked passionately day and night for two weeks to save lives.""Cava said that the search will officially become a recovery mission at midnight.""We have all asked God for a miracle,"" she said. ""So the decision to transition from rescue to recovery is an extremely difficult one.""Nearly half of the building's 136 units were destroyed in the collapse.Officials believe the viability of finding survivors is slim in part because of the ""pancake collapse"" of the building, Ray Jadallah, assistant fire chief of the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Department, said.Floors and walls of the building stacked onto one another, Jadallah said, leaving little space for people to survive. Crews who had at first looked for sounds and other signs of life had switched to instead look for such ""livable spaces"" during the search but found few during their efforts.""Typically an individual has a specific amount of time in regards to lack of food and air, and this collapse, you know, doesn't provide any of that sort,"" Jadallah said.One section of four floors that fell onto one another, for example, left only 3 feet of space between them, he said.Crews had at one point shifted their attention to the east side of the building near a staircase in hopes of finding spaces but were left disappointed.""It was just unprecedented, the lack of void for survivability,"" Jadallah said.Cava said family members of those missing were notified just before the public announcement was made.""To share news with the families who are still missing their loved ones was devastating,"" she said.Crews are expected to remain on the site for weeks. Cominsky said they will continue to work in hopes of finding everyone missing.""We know what our goal was all along, and we continue going forward in trying to locate everyone's loved ones,"" he said.Crews will stop work Wednesday night just before the transition, she said, to mark the hard decision with a moment of silence.""Please pray with me for those we have lost and those we are mourning,"" she said.",Fact,Buzzfeed
https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolefallert/shacarri-richardson-off-olympic-roster-marijuana-test,Sha’Carri Richardson Won't Be Competing In The Olympics After Testing Positive For Cannabis,"Disqualified sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson was left off the USA Track and Field Olympic roster that was released Tuesday, eliminating her from the competition.The move comes after Richardson tested positive on June 19 for THC, the psychoactive substance in cannabis, which she said she used after hearing that her mother had died.The US Anti-Doping Agency announced Richardson’s suspension on Friday, citing the World Anti-Doping Agency’s anti-doping rules. Now, the decision by the USA Track and Field means the young American frontrunner for gold won’t participate in either the relay team or the 100-meter individual race after winning at the Olympic trials in Eugene, Oregon, last month.“First and foremost, we are incredibly sympathetic toward Sha'Carri Richardson's extenuating circumstances and strongly applaud her accountability — and will offer her our continued support both on and off the track,” USA Track and Field said in a statement Tuesday. “While USATF fully agrees that the merit of the World Anti-Doping Agency rules related to THC should be reevaluated, it would be detrimental to the integrity of the U.S. Olympic Team Trials for Track & Field if USATF amended its policies following competition, only weeks before the Olympic Games.”USATF added that its “credibility as the National Governing Body would be lost if rules were only enforced under certain circumstances.”The team extended “heartfelt understanding” to Richardson, but reiterated it must “maintain fairness” for other athletes who qualified for a chance to compete in Tokyo. The team released its updated roster with Gabby Thomas slated for the women’s 100-meter relay and Javianne Oliver, Teahna Daniels, and Jenna Prandini listed for the 100-meter individual race.BuzzFeed News has reached out to Richardson's agent Renaldo Nehemiah, the World Anti-Doping Agency, and USATF for further comment.Richardson took full responsibility for her decision to use cannabis, citing her mother's recent death.""To put on a face, to have to go in front of the world and put on a face and hide my pain, like, who am I to tell you how to cope when you're dealing with a pain or dealing with a struggle that you've never experienced before?” the Dallas native said on Today of her mistake. “I was definitely triggered and blinded by emotions, blinded by badness, and hurting, and hiding hurt.”Richardson also apologized on Twitter, writing, “I’m sorry I can’t be y’all Olympic Champ this year but I promise I’ll be your World Champ next year.”There had been some ambiguity about Richardson’s potential to compete. According to World Athletics rules, USATF had two discretionary picks besides the top four athletes in the 100-meter final, the Associated Press reported. The two flex spots were awarded to English Gardner and Aleia Hobbs before Richardson’s suspension was shortened from three months to 30 days, so adding Richardson would have meant cutting someone else, USA Today reported.The 21-year-old’s 30-day suspension will end before the relays begin on Aug. 5, also raising the question of whether she would be able to run as part of the relay team. But her name was not on the roster as of Tuesday, meaning all of Richardson’s Olympic medal chances have been dashed for the year.USATF’s decision also begs the question of why a drug that is legal and not performance-enhancing merits disqualification. According to USADA's statement on Richardson’s disqualification, THC is classified as a “Substance of Abuse” because “it is frequently used in society outside the context of sport.”In 2020, the World Anti-Doping Agency announced key changes to disciplinary measures for Substance of Abuse, specifically if an athlete can argue the use was out of competition and unrelated to sport performance. These changes directly apply to Richardson’s case.“Richardson’s period of ineligibility was reduced to one month because her use of cannabis occurred out of competition and was unrelated to sport performance, and because she successfully completed a counseling program regarding her use of cannabis,” USADA said. “Her one-month period of ineligibility — the minimum allowed under the rules — is the same result as the two other Substance of Abuse cases that USADA has handled since the 2021 Code took effect.”Still, fans reacted angrily to the news — a petition to the USADA, the International Olympic Committee, and the World Anti-Doping Committee had garnered nearly half a million signatures by Tuesday evening.“The imposition of a penalty against a world-class Black, queer, woman athlete is powerfully and infuriatingly reminiscent of the way drug laws are regularly applied in the United States,” the petition states. “Recreational marijuana use has been de facto legal for upper-middle-class white people for years — something more states are recognizing as they legalize marijuana for all people and consider how to repair the damage done to Black and brown communities by decades of the ‘war on drugs.’”President Joe Biden also weighed in on her disqualification, telling reporters on Saturday that “rules are the rules.""""Everybody knows what the rules are going in,” he added. “I was really proud of the way she responded.”",Fact,Buzzfeed
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jul/08/boris-johnson-announces-end-uk-military-mission-afghanistan,Boris Johnson announces end to UK military mission in Afghanistan,"Boris Johnson has announced the end of Britain’s military mission in Afghanistan following a hasty and secretive exit of the last remaining troops 20 years after the post 9/11 invasion that started the “war on terror”.The prime minister confirmed to MPs that the intervention, which claimed the lives of 457 British soldiers, would end even as the insurgent Taliban were rapidly gaining territory in rural areas, as UK, US and other forces withdrew.Speaking in the Commons, Johnson said “all British troops assigned to Nato’s mission in Afghanistan are now returning home”. While he would not disclose the exact timetable of the departure for security reasons, the prime minister added: “I can tell the house that most of our personnel have already left.”In a separate defence briefing the head of the armed forces, Sir Nick Carter, acknowledged that recent news from Afghanistan had been “pretty grim” but said the Afghan military had been regrouping to defend urban areas.He said that while it was fair to say the Taliban now held nearly 50% of the rural districts in Afghanistan and that the Afghan army would also “no longer have access to [western] air power” from within the country, he hoped there would eventually be peace talks between the Taliban and Afghan government.Britain’s remaining 750-strong contingent, part of a wider Nato stabilisation mission, has been leaving the country over the past few weeks to an operational deadline of 4 July after the US president, Joe Biden, said he wanted to pull out most of the remaining 2,500 American combat troops.Flag-lowering ceremonies have been largely conducted in secret as British forces have pulled out, the last of which took place on 24 June, when the union flag was handed to the British ambassador. Defence sources said the secrecy was at the request of the US, citing operational security.Johnson and Carter both argued that the intervention in Afghanistan had helped foster fundamental changes in the country, citing improvements in access to electricity, water and education, with 8.2 million more children in school.Classrooms included 3.6 million girls, added Johnson, highlighting that before 2001, “[in] Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, virtually no girls attended school”.Labour said Britain was leaving without having secured the gains of the past 20 years. Angela Rayner, the party’s deputy leader, said that while nobody wanted to see British troops permanently stationed in Afghanistan, “if we simply wash our hands or walk away it is hard to see a future without bloodier conflict and wider Taliban control”.In reply, Johnson said he did not believe the Taliban were “guaranteed the kind of victory that you sometimes read about”. Later in the debate he added that the British intervention in Afghanistan “was never intended at any stage to be an open-ended commitment”.There was also unease on the Conservative benches. The former party leader Iain Duncan Smith told MPs the withdrawal was “a little bit like the last days of Vietnam, an unprecedented and hurried exit with no commitment”.Britain will leave behind a small number of troops to support a US-led protection force for diplomats in Kabul, although the Ministry of Defence would not say how many were remaining on the ground.The RAF could become involved in providing air support from airbases outside Afghanistan, following the abandonment last week of the main Bagram base. Losing easy access to air power is a big loss of capability for the Afghan army as it battles to fend off the Taliban advance.The Foreign Office also intends to maintain an embassy in Kabul, although it will not, at least initially, be guarded by British troops. The UK government will provide £100m in aid and £58m for Afghan defence forces.Carter said no provincial capital had fallen in Afghanistan and that it was “entirely possible that the Afghan government defeats the Taliban for long enough for the Taliban to realise that they have to talk”.But he admitted it was one of three possible scenarios for the country, the others being a return to warlordism and a Taliban victory.Johnson also resisted calls to hold a public inquiry into the war, along the lines of the Chilcot report on Iraq, which was called for in the Commons by Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee. It would take too long, Johnson said, adding that the Chilcot inquiry had taken seven years and “cost millions”.British soldiers who served could hold up their heads “very high”, Carter suggested. He paid tribute to the soldiers who had died over the past 20 years. The British army now had a new “combat ethos” learned from fighting in Helmand. “They were never defeated on the battlefield,” he said",Fact,Guardian
https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jul/08/human-body-size-shaped-by-climate-evolutionary-study-shows,"Human body size shaped by climate, evolutionary study shows","A well-known pattern in human evolution is an increase in body and brain size. Our species, Homo sapiens, is part of the Homo genus and emerged about 300,000 years ago. We are much bigger than earlier Homo species and have brains three times larger than humans who lived a million years ago.There has been debate over the factors causing humans to evolve in this way, prompting a research team led by Cambridge University and Tübingen University in Germany to combine data on more than 300 human fossils from the Homo genus with climate models to establish the role the climate played in driving evolution.The team determined what temperature, precipitation and other climate conditions each of the fossils, spanning the last million years, would have experienced when it was a living human. The study, published in Nature Communications, found a strong link between temperature and body size, showing that climate was a key driver of body size during that period.“The colder it gets, the bigger the humans are,” said Dr Manuel Will, a Tübingen University researcher and joint first author on the study. “If you’re bigger, you have a bigger body – you are producing more heat but losing relatively less because your surface is not expanding at the same rate.”This relationship between climate and body mass is consistent with Bergmann’s rule, which predicts a larger bodyweight in colder environments and a smaller bodyweight in warmer environments. This is observed in animal species such as bears – polar bears living in the Arctic, for example, weigh a lot more than brown bears living in comparatively warmer climates.“It’s not completely surprising, but it’s interesting to see that in this respect our evolution isn’t that different from other mammals,” said Dr Nick Longrich, from the University of Bath Milner Centre for Evolution, who was not involved in the research. “We face similar problems when it comes to gaining and losing heat, so we seem to have evolved in similar ways.”The study also found a link between brain size and climate, but the results show that environmental factors have substantially less influence on the brain size than they do on body size.“This phenomenon shows that body and brain size are under different selective pressures,” said Prof Andrea Manica, another researcher on the study. “This study really manages to detangle the fact that both [brain and body size] are increasing, but increasing for very different reasons.”The results showed no association of brain size with temperature. Instead, the researchers linked more stable climates with bigger brains. This effect links to the dietary needs of humans living in environments of variable climatic stability.“The more stable [the climate] is, the larger brains are,” said Will. “You need a lot of energy to maintain a big brain – in stable environments, you find more stable food, so you likely have sufficient nutrition to give you that energy.”Researchers also saw indications of behavioural changes that influence brain size in response to hunting strategies in more open environments. These more indirect factors reveal the complexity in understanding what factors have driven human evolution.“There are other factors bedside climate driving things,” said Longrich. Competitive, social, cultural and technological factors are identified by the researchers but not tested in this study. Future models should aim to include these interacting components.Will points out that evolution is ongoing, but there are different drivers now to a million years ago. “The past gives us clues about the future; we can learn from it. But we cannot simply extrapolate from it,” he said.He explained that while we are currently seeing that the climate is getting warmer, we cannot assume that our bodies will get smaller as a result.",Fact,Guardian

Meaning to say, I am seriously thinking of running for vice president,"" he said.Last month he said the vice presidency was a ""good idea"" because he has unfinished business, like fighting illicit drugs.The mercurial former mayor's critics have questioned the legality of him becoming vice president, because he could reassume the top post if the president dies, resigns, or is removed from office.Opinion polls show Duterte remains very popular, despite a huge death toll in his notorious anti-drugs campaign and criticism of his government's pandemic response.Staying in office could also shield him from legal action, in a country where former leaders and politicians are often prosecuted, sometimes jailed.Duterte, however, admitted he would be an ""inutile"" vice president if the winning president, who is elected in a separate contest, was not a ""friend"".Duterte's daughter, Davao mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio has topped opinion polls on possible presidential contenders. Both Dutertes have ruled that out.He stopped short of endorsing longtime aide and incumbent senator, Christopher ""Bong"" Go, as his preferred successor, but said Go was ""ready"" for the top post. Go said he was not interested.Absent during the party meeting was boxer-turned-senator Manny Pacquiao, who has been in Duterte's crosshairs over public comments on foreign policy and corruption, amid speculation the eight-division champion may seek the presidency.",Fact,CNN

Meeting over, the screen goes blank.”Matthews, a Conservative, was elected as PCC for Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland in May, taking the role from Labour’s Willy Bach, who had held the position since 2016.As PCC, Matthews is tasked with overseeing policing in the area and holding the chief constable to account. The BLM ban applies to staff in his offices only and not the wider police force.“It is extraordinary from somebody who’s meant to be the PCC for the entire Leicestershire area. But it’s not extraordinary when you consider it is a Conservative PCC, and the precedent the Conservative party have set when it comes to race and race relations,” said Sharmen Rahman, a Labour councillor in Leicester.She added that she was not sure what the ban would mean in practice, as Leicester did not have a local BLM organisation.“I just find it sad for the ethnic minority voters in Leicester. The area is very diverse, and the person who’s meant to represent us in the PCC role is essentially shutting out a huge group of minority voices and saying that he isn’t willing to talk to them,” she said.A spokesperson for the Leicestershire PCC said: “I can confirm that Mr Matthews directed his staff to have no contact with the Black Lives Matter organisation – BLM UK – for the reasons outlined in his blog.“For clarity, the organisation is not the same as the Black Lives Matter movement, something he has previously supported and on which his stance is unchanged.”A tryst, an exposé, a resignation: the Matt Hancock affair has painfully exposed problems of poor leadership. It’s a narrative we’ve all seen before: a government that appoints its friends to high places, officials who break their own rules and behave as if there is one rule for them and another for us.The episode once again highlights the urgent need for independent news organisations like the Guardian to scrutinise public figures and hold them to the highest standards.

Looking down at her shoes, the Queen replied: “No, I know. I’ve been told. Probably better not.”Talking to other cast members, she admitted she was not familiar with all the characters and plotlines. “I have not been able to see it all the time. Are you all nice?” she inquired. Ben Price, who plays Nick Tilsley, standing alongside Jack P Shepherd who plays Corrie’s “villain” David Platt, said: “I can confidently say Jack is a bad boy.”It has been 60 years and more than 10,000 episodes, since the enduring story of “everyday lives of ordinary folk” in the fictional northern town of Weatherfield first aired, making it the world’s longest drama serial.Fifty-seven births, 146 deaths and 131 weddings later – not to mention the affairs, murders, secrets and lies – Coronation Street’s blend of pathos and humour continues to attract audiences.Initially based on kitchen-sink realism, the soap opera’s storylines and special effects, have become increasingly dramatic since Ena Sharples and her friends Minnie Caldwell and Martha Longhurst gossiped in the Rovers’ snug in that first episode in December 1960.Plotlines have included Tram Crash Week, which claimed three lives and saw Rita rescued from beneath her collapsed Kabin, while in another, killer and kidnapper Richard Hillman, the husband of Gail Platt, went to a watery grave in the canal.But its famous terraced row has been the backdrop for sensitive issues including teenage pregnancy, assisted dying, and its award-winning introduction of the transgender character Hayley Cropper.The Queen, concluding her tour at the corner shop, was told of the sometimes challenging issues the soap has explored. “Obviously people feel it’s something visible, they can relate to. You don’t really want too much real life, do you?” she said.As a souvenir as she left the set, the Queen was presented with a “Corrie Cobble” from the original set, specially engraved by a local stonemason, and some Newton & Ridley beer mats.The show’s 40th-anniversary show featured Prince Charles, with footage of him meeting Sue Nicholls – Audrey Roberts – incorporated into a live show. The Duchess of Cornwall pulled a pint at the Rovers Return to celebrate the show’s 50th anniversary.Much has changed in 60 years, but the brass-band theme tune remains. Said to have been inspired by the sun streaming through a dreary Manchester day, it is the most played piece of music on British TV.The violent death in the 1970s of Ernest Bishop, the husband of mild-mannered Emily, who was gunned down at Baldwin’s Casuals factory (later to become Underworld) by two burglars robbing the office safe remains one of the biggest shocks.Alan Bradley, the evil businessman who terrorised Rita Fairclough causing her to flee to Blackpool where he tracked her down, met a gruesome end from an oncoming tram.The recently widowed Deirdre Rachid, framed for fraud by the conman pilot Jon Lindsay, was released from prison after the nationwide Free the Weatherfield One campaign.The long -running feud between Ken Barlow and Mike Baldwin finally ended just before the latter died from a heart attack while cradled in the arms of his rival.Richard Hillman, a serial killer and kidnapper and the husband of Gail, went to a watery grave in the canal.The tram crash episode revealed three shock deaths, Fiz giving birth and Rita buried beneath her collapsed, beloved Kabin,",Fact,Guardian

Another official had said earlier there were 56 passengers and six crew.Bagus Puruhito, head of the country’s search and rescue agency Basarnas, said teams had been dispatched to search the waters north of Jakarta. No radio beacon signal had been detected, the agency said.Agus Haryono, another official with the agency, told Reuters that debris suspected to be from the plane had been found in the sea, but it had not been confirmed that it came from the missing flight.Sriwijaya Air, an Indonesian airline, said in a statement it was gathering more detailed information regarding the flight before it could make a fuller statement.The nearly 27-year-old Boeing 737-500 was much older than Boeing’s problem-plagued 737 MAX model, one of which crashed off Jakarta in late 2018, killing all 189 people aboard the Lion Air flight. Older 737 models are widely flown and do not have the system implicated in the MAX safety crisis.A Boeing spokeswoman said, “We are aware of media reports from Jakarta, and are closely monitoring the situation. We are working to gather more information.”Indonesian television channels showed pictures of suspected wreckage.“We found some cables, a piece of jeans, and pieces of metal on the water,” Zulkifli, a security official, told CNNIndonesia.com.Nurhasan, a fisherman in the area known as Thousand Islands, told local media that he and his crew had found several pieces of metal.It was raining at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport when the plane took off for Pontianak, around 740 km (460 miles) away.Video images from the airport showed pictures of relatives of the passengers in tears as they awaited news of what had happened.Rescue official Agus said 50 people were taking part in the search and that they would search into the night.Founded in 2003, Jakarta-based Sriwijaya Air group flies largely within Indonesia.The airline has had a solid safety record until now, with no onboard casualties in four incidents recorded on the Aviation Safety Network database, though a farmer was killed when a Boeing 737-200 left the runway in 2008 following a hydraulic problem.The Boeing 737 is the world’s most-sold family of aircraft and has undergone several makeovers since it entered service in 1968.The 737-500 is two generations of development before the most recent 737 MAX, which has been embroiled in a worldwide safety crisis following crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. It does not use the software system implicated in those crashes.Nonetheless, experts say planes such as Sriwijaya’s leased 737-500 are being phased out for newer fuel-saving models. Civil jets typically have an economic life of 25 years, meaning they become too expensive to keep flying beyond that compared to younger models, but they are built to last longer. ",Fact,Huffington Post

Symptoms in non–immune animals include high fever, coughing and nasal discharge.It is not yet known how long the current shut-down of racing may have to last, however there are echoes of the foot-and-mouth crises of 1967 and 2001.On each occasion, the racing calendar was affected for two months – and in 2001, the Cheltenham Festival was abandoned.A further update on the possible continued extent of disruption is expected from the BHA – with a packed weekend of Cheltenham trials and other big races scheduled at Newbury, Warwick, Musselburgh and in Ireland.",Fact,Huffington Post

We need robust tech accountability.Social media companies have spent years allowing Trump to use his platform to wreak havoc in ways that should have resulted in, according to their own terms of conditions, further action.From sharing damaging information about Covid-19 to inciting racial hatred by retweeting a video of someone shouting “white power” during the height of last year’s Black Lives Matter protests, social media companies have only ever been quick to act on those wishing Trump harm, but not on any of the harm he’s caused.Social media companies have only take action after an act, of what I can only describe as terrorism, from his supporters, encouraged by him and only with 11 days in office remaining. Why was this level of violence the tipping point to act? So why have tech giants only now just decided enough is enough? It’s important to clearly state that what happened in the Capitol didn’t materialise from thin air. This is why it is important for all tech companies to first acknowledge their role. They must own up to the fact they have been egregiously slow to act, and their inaction has helped contribute to today’s climate in the US. They must also recognise the enormous amount of work not-for-profit organisations have done in calling on social media platforms to make their spaces fairer and safer.What we saw transpire over the past few days – let alone the past few years – was preventable, at least in part. The problem with social media companies being slow to act on Trump isn’t a single issue; it speaks to a much bigger issue brewing under the surface: the lack of accountability, transparency and regulation that social media companies have.And it’s not just Trump’s online violence that we’ve seen social media turn a blind eye to – it’s taking any action or responsibility.Just last year, Facebook failed its civil rights audit. Glitch’s Covid-19 report showed that over 80% of online abuse for women and non-binary people came from Twitter, Facebook and the companies that Facebook own (Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger).It shouldn’t be down to a few rich white men holding all the power, deciding if to act, and when. We need robust tech accountability.Tech giants have a magnitude of influence over billions of people, governments, democracies and economies. This is why discussion around Trump’s eventual ban can’t just be about him as an individual. Wider systemic change is needed and therefore the end of self-regulation.What we saw transpire over the past few days – let alone the past few years – was preventable,...In less than two weeks, Trump will no longer be president. But the problems with fascism, radicalisation, safety and digital self-care on these platforms won’t disappear with him.I worry that the levels of destruction and damage that social media companies have caused by allowing Trump and his supporters to thrive whilst spieling hate and misinformation is on a scale that we don’t yet fully understand the extent of. The far right isn’t the only issue that needs to be addressed – the disproportionate levels of abuse that women face, and the lack of digital citizenship, education and research – are major problems too. If we don’t call for wider action from our institutions now, then at what point will we be able to? Will it take more women to face abuse or another incident of terrorism before we implement the necessary accountability measures to make online spaces safe for all? We need institutions to ask the right questions, and faster. The UK has announced the long awaited Online Harms Bill and European States are proposing the European Digital Services Directive. While good initiatives, these will take years and so we need a short to medium term plan for the interim: taxing tech companies and portioning an amount for online safety and digital citizenship education. While social media companies continue to ignore their very real influence on the offline world, the far right continues to grow, misinformation continues to spread, and the steps towards an irreversible path continue to be trod. If we continue on the current trajectory, social media companies’ dominance and influence will continue to advance, while their profits do too. All at the expense of people’s physical and online safety. While we may welcome social media companies finally banning Trump, it’s crucial that we ask why they didn’t act sooner – why they didn’t act for women, Black communities, Jewish communities and other minority groups. As we go into 2021, as digital citizens, we must continue to demand they address the growing online harms thriving on their platforms. ",Opinion,Huffington Post

Critics argued the changes would hurt the middle class.Riot police clash with protesters in Medellin, Colombia, on June 2.The tax reform has since been abandoned. But marches and demonstrations have only increased in scale and pace over a series of issues, including the country's chronic income inequality and allegations of police brutality.According to human rights organizations in Colombia, more than 70 people have been killed on the streets since the protest begun, they claim often at the hands of the Colombian security forces.However, the Colombian Attorney General disputes those figures, saying that only 24 deaths have been proven to be linked to the protests. In a statement to CNN, Colombia's National Police said it had opened investigations over 16 cases of alleged murders at the hand of police agents.The Colombian Foreign Ministry on Wednesday published a statement rejecting some of the actions recommended by the IACHR, saying that ""the lethal cases involving members of the security forces are exceptional.""Duque also addressed the report in person, claiming that ""nobody can recommend a country to be tolerant with criminal acts.""He said Colombia was a country that ""respect the peaceful protest."" But added that ""the acts of vandalism, urban terrorism, and the roadblocks are being confronted with the constitution and the law.""The IACHR investigates allegations of human rights abuse in the American Hemisphere under the Organization of American States. It has cited security forces' use of non-lethal weapons toward protesters as a particularly worrying cause of injuries and mutilations.'My brother is dead'Marlin Niño's brother, Brayan, died on May 1 in Madrid, a suburb of Bogota, after he was hit by a gas canister shot by a police vehicle. After his death, the Colombian attorney general arrested a police major on charges of murdering the 24-year-old protester.Prior to his detention, the mayor spoke with local media and lamented the death of the protesters, but claimed he followed police protocols in dealing with street demonstrations.Amid escalating violence, Colombia sends in troopsHis case is one of sixteen cases of alleged murder at the hands of the police that are being investigated, the Police Inspector General told CNN in a statement.In an exclusive interview with CNN prior to the publication of the IACHR report, Colombia's Justice Minister Wilson Ruiz pledged that the Colombian government would show zero tolerance toward police abuses. He welcomed the Attorney General's investigation as an opportunity to present evidence to the entire country.But Niño's sister Marlin told CNN in June that she fears there may be no consequences for her brother's death.""Sometimes I am so overwhelmed I just don't want to know any more and be over it. My brother's dead... but at the same time I tell myself: today is my brother, tomorrow who else could it be?"" she said.The IACHR report urges Colombia to try cases involving allegations of police brutality in civilian courts, rather than military tribunals to avoid the circumstance of agents being tried by fellow servicemen.Niño's case is being investigated by both the ordinary Attorney General's office and military justice attorneysEven before the release of the report, President Duque had announced a reform of the police which includes further accountability mechanism and additional training for the agents in the areas of human rights, one of the recommendations made by the IACHR.The anger driving Colombia&#39;s protest movement isn&#39;t going away anytime soonThe anger driving Colombia's protest movement isn't going away anytime soonBut Duque has so far resisted the recommendation that Colombia separate its police force from the Ministry of Defense, which oversees all security forces in the country.Ingrid Betancourt, a former presidential candidate who was kidnapped and held for more than six years by rebel guerrillas in the early 2000s, also points to enduring war-like mentality as the next challenge ahead for the reeling nation.""This is part of what we could have expected, knowing that we were introducing people from the war to the civil society and that we needed to adjust our institutions,"" she told CNN.""And now that people don't hear the sound of the gun machines, they want to be in the streets protesting for their rights, and that I think it's good.""",Fact,CNN

Its DNA has been recovered at the scene of the attack, and it will be compared with that of any bear that authorities trap.A friend of Ms Lokan's, Mary Flowers, told AP news agency that Ms Lokan had taken long-distance bike trips in the past. On this latest journey she had been accompanied by her sister and a friend.""She loved these kind of adventures,"" said Ms Flowers. ""She had a passion for life that was out of the ordinary.""The FWP said the bear first approached the campers at around 03:00 local time (09:00 GMT), but initially ran away.Ms Lokan and her two companions, who were staying in a separate tent, then removed food from their tents and secured them before going back to sleep. But the bear returned shortly afterwards, leading to the fatal attack.Ovando, a community of fewer than 100 people, sits on the edge of Glacier National Park - an expanse of forests and mountains stretching over the border into Canada.The park is home to the largest concentration of bears within the contiguous US, but fatal attacks are rare in the region. Over the last 20 years there have been two other incidents, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service.Bears that attack people are not always killed if their attack results from a surprise encounter, or if the bear was defending its young.But a Montana FWP spokesperson told AP that the bear involved in Ms Lokan's death is considered a threat because of the nature of the attack.",Fact,BBC

It sees what other imaging systems can't.This much has been true since the first radar satellites were launched decades ago. What's changing is the number of spacecraft we now have at our disposal.Low-cost, high-fidelity components and access to cheaper rocket launches means we're entering the era of constellations - of large networks of spacecraft.'Eyes of a machine': How to classify Planet Earth'It hit the valley floor like 15 atomic bombs'The biggest of these Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) constellations is operated by Iceye, a young company based in Helsinki, Finland.It has 14 spacecraft circling the globe, six of which it has in a very tightly controlled train.This configuration ensures they come back over exactly the same spot each day, looking at the scene from the same height and angle.It gives the satellite train's pictures ""coherence"". They can be run smoothly together, to pick out the smallest of changes.The repeatability is put to good use here in the ""movie"" of the eruption of Iceland's Fagradalsfjall volcano.We all saw the spectacular fountains of lava from ground level, but the Iceye imagery gives the overhead view of Fagradalsfjall and tracks the molten rock as it spreads away from the primary volcanic cone. You see other cones forming along a distinct fissure line.media captionFagradalsfjall: Satellites give us a different perspective to events viewed on the groundThe pictures were gathered by the Iceye satellites between 1 April and 6 May. Remember, whether there was cloud or ash or haze over the area was irrelevant to the acquisition.""What we're doing is something called a daily ground-track repeat,"" explained Iceye CEO Rafal Modrzewski. ""To do that, you have to tune the satellite's orbit so that it doesn't cover the whole Earth anymore. It actually only covers about a sixth of the globe.""Now, that's potentially a big problem because you don't want to launch a system into the sky that's supposed to be global, and it's not a global! But we can make a trade-off. Because we have so many satellites, we can put six of them in a one-day repeat orbit and have a full global coverage,"" he told BBC News.Also on this page, you can see an interferogram of Fagradalsfjall. This is made by comparing two precisely aligned images from different passes over the same spot.Scientists can tell from the coloured fringes where and by how much the ground has moved. It's a technique that's particularly useful in volcanology to track bulging underground magma chambers, or in earthquake research to trace faults that don't always rupture to the surface during a big tremor.Iceye recently concluded an agreement with the European Space Agency that will give scientists access to its data, including the capabilities demonstrated on this page.The company is currently building six new satellites that it hopes to have launched by the year's end. When Iceye started out, it was aiming for a constellation of about 18 spacecraft. But this number could well grow with time. The firm would like to get that ground-track repeat down to 12 hours.Just to put this in context, the best repeat cycle out there now beyond Iceye is in the order of several days.This movie depicts the movement of ice on a section of the 60km-long Muldrow Glacier, which flows down the north side of Denali, the tallest mountain in North America. The images were taken with Iceye's radar satellites between 16 and 30 April. This year has seen the Alaskan glacier undergo one of its periodic surges when it can move by up to tens of metres a day. Muldrow seems to do this every 50 years or so.Rotterdam is Europe's busiest port. Goods weighing hundreds of millions of tonnes pass through it every year. Something like 30,000 ocean-going vessels tied up at Rotterdam in 2020 to load and unload. These movies show the frenetic activity at the port - the ships coming and going; cranes moving down the quayside to shift and stack the containers; even the ups and downs of the oil storage tanks. The imagery was acquired 16-28 March. Information like this can be useful to financial markets because it gives early warning of volume changes in global trade.",Fact,BBC

That very simple sing-along chorus just makes it perfect, and everyone knows it.""Paul Carr, professor in popular music analysis at the University of South Wales, who wrote a recent article about what makes a great tournament anthem, adds: ""It's a song that's got a lot of nostalgic resonance for many of the people who sing it.""The big thing is simplicity of the melody, and there's something in the lyrics.""Simple but emotive phrases like ""Good times never felt so good"" and ""Reaching out, touching me, touching you"" are coupled with the anticipatory build-up, leading to a rousing chorus. That all makes it a feelgood communal sing-along - especially after more than a year of lockdowns and social distancing.Diamond has said he actually wrote the love song about his wife Marcia, but her name didn't fit the tune. However, he had remembered a magazine photo he had seen of Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of John F Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy.His song reached number four in the US chart and number eight in the UK, and became a staple of Diamond's live shows. But the first hint of its potential as a sporting crowd-pleaser came in the late 1990s when it was played during a Boston Red Sox baseball game for an employee who had named her newborn Caroline.The Red Sox decided it was good luck, and started playing it every week from 2003. In 2013, the singer pledged all future royalties from the tune to a charity supporting victims of the Boston Marathon bombing.Other teams on both sides of the Atlantic began to adopt it, from the NFL's Carolina Panthers to the Northern Irish football side.Arsenal played it after their 2017 FA Cup semi-final victory, and it has also been claimed by fans of Aston Villa and the Castleford Tigers rugby league side. Meanwhile, the England cricket team celebrated their 2019 World Cup victory with a rendition, and boxer Tyson Fury has used it to rousing effect.It's far from the first pop song to find a new lease of life in a sport stadium. Liverpool FC's anthem You'll Never Walk Alone was written for the hit musical Carousel, while Scotland fans have claimed the 1977 hit Yes Sir, I Can Boogie.Why do Scotland fans sing Yes Sir, I Can Boogie?After England's Euro 2020 quarter-final win over Germany, Wembley DJ Tony Parry said he went with his instinct to play Sweet Caroline instead of Fat Les's 1998 World Cup anthem Vindaloo.He told TalkSport: ""I was going to play Vindaloo, but went with my gut. Even the German fans were belting it out in the end. It's a song that all fans can enjoy.""The match director said in my in-ear, 'The world's been closed for 18 months… let 'em have it'.""England fans in full voice at Wembley StadiumIMAGE COPYRIGHTREUTERSSweet Caroline has even threatened to eclipse Three Lions as the England fans' song of choice at the pandemic-delayed tournament.""I thought Sweet Caroline went slightly better than Three Lions in the post-match sing-song,"" Three Lions co-writer Frank Skinner noted after the Germany game. ""I felt like we'd beat Germany and lost to Neil Diamond in extra time.""How Three Lions became the definitive England songThree Lions was originally penned as England's official track for Euro 96 by Skinner, fellow comedian David Baddiel and The Lightning Seeds' Ian Broudie, who captured the football-fevered dreams of a host nation starved of success.Ian Broudie, Frank Skinner and David BaddielIMAGE COPYRIGHTGETTY IMAGESimage captionIan Broudie, lead singer of The Lightning Seeds, wrote Three Lions with Frank Skinner (middle) and David Baddiel (right) in 1996A firm fan favourite by the time England thrillingly progressed to the semi-finals - only to gallantly lose to Germany on penalties when current England manager Gareth Southgate, then a player, saw his spot-kick saved - the song's refrain of ""30 years of hurt"" could equally eulogise glorious failure.The track has continued to ingrain itself in culture, topping the charts on a record four separate occasions, most recently during England's 2018 World Cup run, before sound tracking the side on this summer's run to the final.But with Sweet Caroline now getting such a huge raucous reaction, news of its popularity has even reached 80-year-old Diamond himself, who told The Telegraph he was ""thrilled"" at the scenes. He also sent a good luck message to the players before Wednesday's semi-final.The England squad have certainly thrived in the atmosphere it creates.""You can't beat a bit of Neil Diamond,"" Southgate told ITV before Wednesday's game. ""It's just a really joyous song, I think, that brings people together.""Three other pop songs for England fans to singWhole Again - Atomic KittenOriginally a hit for the girl group back in 2001, England fans revived the pop ballad at the height of World Cup mania in the summer of 2018, borrowing lyrics from Three Lions to rework it as an ode to Southgate and the team.Fans changed the lyrics ""Baby you're the one, you still turn me on, you can make me whole again"" to ""Southgate you're the one, you still turn me on, football's coming home again"".In light of renewed interest at Euro 2020, the girl group - now comprising Liz McClarnon, Jenny Frost and Natasha Hamilton - announced on Tuesday that they were releasing the new version.They gave a public performance of the track, called Southgate You're The One (Football's Coming Home Again), in Leicester Square ahead of the match on Wednesday, backed by the Hyde Park Brass band.They said it had been a ""whirlwind couple of days"", but they were ""super excited"" to contribute to the celebrations.Freed From Desire - GalaGala's 90s euro dance track was first fully embraced by Northern Ireland's fans during Euro 2016.They adopted a version paying tribute to the club form of striker, Will Grigg, whose goals had helped Wigan win League One that season and inspired Latics supporter Sean Kennedy to change the lyrics to ""Will Grigg's on fire... your defence is terrified"".It was then adapted by England fans to the tune of ""Vardy's on fire"" and remains popular in football celebrations across nations, breaking the language barrier with its effortlessly chantable ""na, na"" chorus.Seven Nation Army - The White StripesJack and Meg White's 2003 mega-smash has its beginnings as a football anthem at the 2006 World Cup, when Italy fans celebrated their team's success in Germany.The squad would also eventually join in, singing the guitar refrain as part of their victory celebrations. It has since become the soundtrack to a plethora of sporting events and crowd celebrations worldwide.Discussing the track's ubiquity as a chant in 2014, White told US TV host Conan O'Brien: ""People come up to me all the time, and they think it makes me mad for some reason.""""I don't know why they think it upsets me. As a songwriter, that's the greatest thing that could ever happen. It becomes folk music.""",Fact,BBC
